235,It is not to the same client.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

341,Thank you for taking my question.,0.0,0.667,0.333,0.3612
342,My first question was continuation on the margin,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

344,"At the end of the fourth quarter, and not just Infosys but across the industry what the",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

347,Now Salil what do you think could be the reason behind that?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
348,Is it driven by,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
349,higher than expected demand and higher use of subcontracting than what you are planning early,0.097,0.903,0.0,-0.128

360,attrition is coming down.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
361,Our quarter attrition figure is actually below our LTM figures and as Salil,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

366,The freshers will start coming in and getting permeated.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
367,So that benefit in a,0.0,0.55,0.45,0.507

417,inflation will impact the balance of the year.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

420,"So you mentioned that attrition has in fact moved lower, do you think attrition continues to",0.128,0.872,0.0,-0.296

423,Nilanjan Roy,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
424,I think like we started last year we were very clear that we have to be competitive in the market.,0.0,0.706,0.294,0.7264

432,"Other than that, I think these are quite competitive and of course if you see in the mix, we also get",0.0,0.909,0.091,0.2484
433,a lot of laterals where there is a hidden cost of hiring because they come at stretches.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

435,your overall weighted average compensation in any case is going up across.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
436,I think overall this is a,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
437,very competitive hike.,0.0,0.501,0.499,0.2484
438,In India it is more like high single digits and in overseas geos because of,0.0,0.834,0.166,0.4201
439,high wage inflation across we have given very competitive hikes.,0.0,0.819,0.181,0.2484

441,not done before.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
442,So these are very much higher than what we did in the past.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
443,But we think this is,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
444,something which is going to stand up in good stead in terms of attrition and we have seen three,0.0,0.861,0.139,0.4404

492,"One, is from a margin perspective,",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
493,whatever we saw as one offs in the previous quarter which included visa and these contract,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
494,provisions - both of them have been sort of offset in this quarter is that a fair understanding?,0.0,0.881,0.119,0.3182
495,The,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
496,second is in terms of salary increases is it only for the associate level this quarter and if so then,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

498,level and general understanding is mid level obviously as a percentage of the employee cost it,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
499,should be higher so the thought process was about should not your margin impact be even higher,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

541,our whole business.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
542,And the way I would look at it is with all of that given our pipeline we have,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
543,increased our revenue guidance.,0.0,0.588,0.412,0.2732
544,So the majority of our business is still seeing good demand.,0.112,0.672,0.216,0.34
545,It is,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
546,"really pockets without quantifying, that is how I would give a context to it.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
547,Bryan Bergin,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
548,Okay and then just a follow-up on margin.,0.0,0.787,0.213,0.2263
549,You gave sequential changes can you give us what the,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
550,year-on-year changes in operating margin with the different categories?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
551,Nilanjan Roy,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
552,So largely we know it was the comp related hike that is near only about 370 basis points that was,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
553,the biggest one and there were some rupee benefits offset by both cross currency as well and,0.0,0.761,0.239,0.5719
554,"then we got some benefits of cost optimization, we got some hits on lower utilization.",0.113,0.619,0.268,0.4588
555,So these are,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
556,the broad things but the biggest one was the comp which was about 370 basis points.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
557,Bryan Bergin,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

561,Please go ahead.,0.0,0.465,0.535,0.3182
562,Sudheer Guntupalli,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
563,Good morning gentlemen.,0.0,0.408,0.592,0.4404
564,Thanks for giving me this opportunity.,0.0,0.27,0.73,0.7964
565,I have just one question on,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
566,margins.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
567,Ideally the strong growth at the headline level should have translated into some operating,0.0,0.558,0.442,0.8271
568,"leverage, but that does not seem to be happening and Nilanjan we seem to be of the view, we will",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
569,chase growth for now and focus on margin optimization at a later date.,0.0,0.679,0.321,0.6369
570,What is the risk to that,0.296,0.704,0.0,-0.2732
571,hypothesis because this growth margin paradox seem to be a mere reflection of what is happening,0.076,0.761,0.163,0.3818
572,"in U.S. and U.K. now a very tight job market, very high nominal growth, but very little benefit",0.0,0.73,0.27,0.7105
573,trickling down to the bottomline level.,0.194,0.806,0.0,-0.0516
574,So sooner or later this nominal growth rates may cool off and,0.0,0.671,0.329,0.5994
575,onsite job markets and some supply costs may auto recalibrate.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
576,But back in India job market may,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
577,not be as much of a free market as it is in U.K. and U.S. there may be some sticky elements both,0.0,0.864,0.136,0.5106
578,at headcount and wage level translating into negative operating leverage as demand moderates.,0.321,0.679,0.0,-0.6369
579,So what is the risk that margins will remain structurally lower than even the pre-COVID levels,0.235,0.765,0.0,-0.5106
580,going ahead because demand tends to be more cyclical while some of these supply costs tend to,0.086,0.914,0.0,-0.128
581,be more sticky?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
582,Nilanjan Roy,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
583,There are a couple of things.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
584,See one is that many of these cost increases cannot be passed on,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
585,the client on day one.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
586,If I have to give a wage hike on all my existing base they will come up for,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
587,renewals that is the time when you have a wage discussion.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
588,"When you are doing new deal,",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
589,automatically we will build it and the industry in a way will build it into their wage profile.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
590,So these,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
591,"things will automatically flow back, there is no free lunch for anybody.",0.197,0.803,0.0,-0.4023
592,So that is one thing which,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
593,"will happen over a period of time, but that is more of a generic point I am making.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
594,But in terms of,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
595,"subcons, we have operated at 6%-6.5% of subcon; today we are sitting at 11.3%, there is no",0.121,0.879,0.0,-0.296
596,reason for us to be at these levels unless we know what the job market is.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
597,In the overall demand,0.333,0.667,0.0,-0.128
598,"environment, when our recruiting picks up we can replace these subcons with our own headcount,",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
599,put more freshers into projects and this is something we have been doing very well in the past as,0.0,0.883,0.117,0.3384
600,well.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.2732
601,"So I think these levers are well known for us, we know how utilization works, our pyramid",0.0,0.884,0.116,0.2732

603,Sudheer Guntupalli,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
604,Just one more question if I may.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
605,"So when we say the pipeline is larger now, just curious if the",0.0,0.839,0.161,0.3182
606,"pipeline is getting bigger and bigger because some of the decision making is getting slower, is",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
607,there any correlation you read in between the two?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
608,Salil Parekh,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
609,The pipeline what we are seeing is there is appetite and you go by different industry for Digital,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

611,"efficiency, that is what is in the pipeline.",0.0,0.737,0.263,0.3612

624,Thank you for taking my question.,0.0,0.667,0.333,0.3612
625,First question is what is the level of conservatism or realism,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
626,"infused into both the revenue and the margin guide this time, part of that is on the revenue guide",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

636,This is Salil.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
637,Let me start off and then Nilanjan may have a few points to,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
638,add.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
639,"On the guidance for growth, as we have shared in the past, the approach we take is we see",0.0,0.773,0.227,0.6124
640,how things are as we look at the financial year today.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
641,What we saw is in Q1 we had extremely,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
642,strong revenue growth - 5.5% and we also had underlying volume growth which was very strong.,0.0,0.498,0.502,0.902
643,"When we see the outlook, where we have clarity looking ahead for some period of time and then a",0.0,0.87,0.13,0.4019
644,set of estimates that we have for the rest of the financial year and also looking at how typically H2,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
645,works versus H1 and then putting in some views on where the end of the year could be.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
646,Based on,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
647,"that, we felt comfortable to increase the revenue growth guidance, whether it is conservative or",0.0,0.594,0.406,0.802
648,realistic that is the approach we take to make sure that we then share what we think the revenue is,0.0,0.8,0.2,0.5423
649,going to look like from here.,0.0,0.667,0.333,0.3612
650,On the margin I will start off and then Nilanjan will talk a little bit about the wage component and,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
651,what we have done.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
652,"Overall on the margin, we have made sure that we work to get all of the",0.0,0.867,0.133,0.3182

654,"So the approach to driving cost efficiency is in place, several levers that Nilanjan",0.0,0.839,0.161,0.3612

656,increase already done in Q1.,0.0,0.635,0.365,0.3182
657,So yes there is a small component but it is not really a huge,0.164,0.716,0.119,-0.1915
658,component that will come up and then we see steadily other areas which will help us.,0.0,0.847,0.153,0.4019
659,There are,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
660,"areas where we can focus on how the subcontracting works, there are areas where we can focus",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
661,"on discussions with clients vis-à-vis wage increases and COLA, areas where we are doing work",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
662,which is having significant impact for clients.,0.0,0.769,0.231,0.2023
663,So we think there are a set of those levers that can help us through the margin discussion that will,0.0,0.876,0.124,0.4019
664,be focused on in this financial year.,0.0,0.698,0.302,0.3818

716,wanted to be very clear that that is something that is visible.,0.0,0.792,0.208,0.4391
717,Couple of examples we have shared,0.0,0.676,0.324,0.34

725,Yes we have hired a lot of freshers last year and many of them also have gone into training,0.0,0.87,0.13,0.4019
