121,What we see today is the demand environment from our client base is strong.,0.089,0.714,0.196,0.4215

127,That reversal in any case is not such that will make a huge impact in the full year.,0.0,0.881,0.119,0.3182

133,Is this the sticky new level given the nature of deals you are signing?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

135,Nilanjan Roy I think many of the large deals which we get is through bundling our services with the software and the allied services and that gives us a multiplier effect in the client landscape.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

140,Some of them in the year past were tailwinds; for instance the onsite offshore mix.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

144,"Of course, this is a much longer haul, it happens more on T&M, renewals etc.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
145,But for FP side of the business these are much more longer-term discussions.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
146,And these are also competitively bid but I think the discussions have started.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

154,"And this is a followup looking at the margin guidance for FY2023, I would see you have brought down by a 100 basis point.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
155,Are we assuming they picked up from the wage inflation here and then are we also assuming lower pricing power which is something that actually did help in terms of levers hardly for the past 6 to 12 months.,0.053,0.883,0.064,0.128

161,It is not a big impact but less than 1%.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

179,Nitin Padmanabhan Hi good evening just two questions from my side.,0.0,0.775,0.225,0.4404
180,The first one was on the guidance.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
181,"So, if I understand right, typically you have a high visibility for the next two quarters and if I look at the last year net new deal wins, it is actually lower than the prior year.",0.055,0.852,0.093,0.3612
182,"So I was just wondering is the mix of much smaller deals which do not reflect within the overall large deal win number that you are talking about, is that a much higher number, is that we should think about it?",0.0,0.856,0.144,0.6597
183,Second is the pipeline of larger deals that could come through that is giving the confidence or is it the smaller deals?,0.0,0.778,0.222,0.6908
184,so that was the first question.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
185,Salil Parekh Thanks for the question.,0.0,0.633,0.367,0.4404
186,We are not specifying today the different types of deals within the mix.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
187,Few points to give some color on it.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
188,First the pipeline that we see today is the largest pipeline we have in terms of large deals so that gives us a good confidence.,0.0,0.788,0.212,0.7351
189,Our net new for the year is strong.,0.0,0.68,0.32,0.5106
190,"We have good momentum exiting this financial year 2022, which gives us a good foundation for next year and we see continued traction within clients, as we are expanding as we are consolidating, as we are gaining market share, so that gives us added boost.",0.0,0.748,0.252,0.91

192,Nitin Padmanabhan Sure.,0.0,0.465,0.535,0.3182
193,The second question was in terms of how are you seeing onsite wage inflation broadly?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
194,"When you compare the prior year, do you see that at a much higher level for the industry in the US, just wanted your thoughts on that.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
195,"And finally, any specifics on the financial services space which is relatively softer and for life sciences where we actually saw a sharp drop for the quarter?",0.075,0.925,0.0,-0.2732
196,"Salil Parekh On the wage inflation, outside India is definitely higher than what we were seeing last year and that will become a part of how we factor in our overall compensation increase.",0.0,0.861,0.139,0.6124
197,Wage inflation numbers in most of the western geographies are higher today than they were 12 months ago.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
198,"On financial services while in the quarter we saw the QoQ was lower, the overall demand environment remains very strong for us in this segment.",0.126,0.751,0.123,0.2247
199,We see a good pipeline there.,0.0,0.633,0.367,0.4404
200,There were significant large deal wins for the year and in the quarter and we remain confident with the growth in financial services.,0.0,0.627,0.373,0.8834
201,"In life sciences conversely, we had in the previous quarter several onetime large deals and that is what made the QoQ look softer.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
202,It is a smaller unit for us.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
203,"So, there is much more volatility in that, but the underlying demand in life sciences looks to be in good shape.",0.071,0.772,0.157,0.4767
204,"Keith Bachman I want to ask a question about what are your assumptions on attrition and utilization, how should we be thinking about those terms over FY2023 and specifically if you could correlate what is the impact in terms of your margin guidance that you provided here today of 21% to 23%?",0.0,0.975,0.025,0.0772
205,Nilanjan Roy I think firstly on the utilization we are still at the higher end at 87%.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
206,We want to bring this down.,0.0,0.794,0.206,0.0772
207,"Now having said that, a lot of this will happen through the influx of freshers.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
208,So it is not a dollar for a dollar in that sense.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
209,"The utilization will start impacting by putting in more freshers who are at a lower cost, but will still have a margin headwind.",0.068,0.932,0.0,-0.1531
210,But if you looking for a math behind it there is no straight correlation because it is not one for one in that sense.,0.08,0.92,0.0,-0.2498
211,So that is first.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
212,"On attrition, yes, we think that this should come down in the following year.",0.0,0.828,0.172,0.4019
213,"The impact that we are seeing now – the impact of putting freshers in – not only by us, but by the entire industry because it was a rotational churn issue across the industry.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
214,"As the industry puts in freshers, there is a new source of supply across the industry as well.",0.0,0.89,0.11,0.2732
215,And finally the intervention which we are doing now as well.,0.0,0.826,0.174,0.2732
216,"So, that is all factored into our 21% to 23%.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
217,"We are also looking at investments, like Salil said, around cloud, around digital capabilities; and therefore that is also baked into the next year’s guidance.",0.0,0.906,0.094,0.3612
218,"Keith Bachman Okay just to clarify and then I will see the floor, does the attrition come down for the industry or Infosys or both.",0.0,0.927,0.073,0.2263
219,"Nilanjan Roy It will be both, I do not think we are in a silo on the ecosystem, we are all interconnected.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
220,My attrition is somebody else lateral and somebody else’s attrition is my lateral and therefore if the industry has to come out of this it is fundamentally through volume.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
221,"Volume has to be through fresher, there is no other source of volume.",0.155,0.845,0.0,-0.296

225,Thanks for giving me the opportunity.,0.0,0.27,0.73,0.7964
226,Nilanjan as you made a comment that pre-pandemic we were at 21.3% margin and our current margin guidance band is also somewhere around that.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
227,So should we read this margin downgrade as more of a structural reset in the company’s aspirational profitability going back to pre-COVID margin levels or should we see this more of a onetime downgrade for FY2023 led by transient supply side pressures.,0.052,0.901,0.047,-0.0516
228,"Nilanjan Roy Yes, so as you know, we only give the margin guidance for the year – 21% to 23% and FY2020 operating margin was 21.3%.",0.0,0.903,0.097,0.4019
229,"We will see where we end up, but the comfortable range for FY2023 is 21% to 23% - nothing more than that.",0.0,0.825,0.175,0.6652
230,Just talking about the investments we are going to make- not only on talent.,0.152,0.848,0.0,-0.3252
231,This is a robust demand environment and we do not want to lose highly skilled talents.,0.126,0.508,0.366,0.7363

233,"We are rolling out intervention on the sales side, on the marketing side, on the digital, cloud.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

235,That is something which we have looked at and baked into the margin for next year.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
236,Sudheer Guntupalli Sure Sir.,0.0,0.566,0.434,0.3182
237,"An extension of this question, the current exit margin rate in March 2022 and margin downgrade for FY2023 it gives a bit of a deja vu feeling of the exit margin and guidance situation exactly 3 years ago in March 2019.",0.0,0.964,0.036,0.128
238,"In fact, we were not staring at so many margin headwinds like we are now barring a bit of an elevated attrition at that time.",0.0,0.906,0.094,0.3612
239,"So my question is, is it fair to assume that for the next four quarters margin trajectory will trace somewhat of a similar path like getting FY2020 where the current delta in growth will likely take care of the delta in margin headwinds or do you see any major divergences in terms of how the pattern will play out over the next four quarters.",0.0,0.819,0.181,0.9001
240,"Nilanjan Roy So, yes like I said on the margin side we know there is going to be a Q1 impact.",0.0,0.785,0.215,0.6369
241,We know there are more longer-term cost optimizations we can resort to.,0.0,0.836,0.164,0.2878

243,"And of course, growth will always help.",0.0,0.485,0.515,0.6486
244,And you've seen that the impact of growth on our operating leverage also has helped in the past.,0.0,0.867,0.133,0.3818
245,"So, it's a combination of all this.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
246,Divya Nagarajan Thanks for taking my question and congrats on what has been a great year overall.,0.0,0.574,0.426,0.886
247,"Looking forward I think this question has been attempted in different ways by some of the earlier questions that came through, but if you were to kind of think about your guidance on revenue for the full year and think about what are the puts and takes in terms of any delta that you might see on demand, how comfortable do you feel that you have a cushion?",0.024,0.914,0.062,0.5719
248,"If I also look at your past track record, you have taken up guidance pretty much every year consistently multiple times during the year.",0.0,0.878,0.122,0.4939
249,Is there enough buffer on both sides of the equation is my first question.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
250,"Salil Parekh The way we looked at our growth guidance, we really try to take a look at where is the demand today, what we have done with large deals, what we are seeing across many of our accounts.",0.036,0.9,0.063,0.2732
251,"For example, if you see some of the statistics that we share, number of accounts over $100 mn or $50 mn- they have seen big movements over the last 12, 24, 36 months.",0.0,0.899,0.101,0.3612

253,"Those are the things we built in, to build the guidance and that is the approach we take every year and in April as we look ahead and then as the year moves, as we get other information we try to then see how best to communicate what we are seeing in the demand environment.",0.026,0.903,0.072,0.5719
254,It’s the same approach that we will follow.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
255,"So, it is difficult for example to say what does it mean there is a cushion and not cushion because at this stage what we see is what we are sharing which is 13% to 15% on the growth and in every quarter with the broad-based connection we have with clients and interactions across the industry we will continue to share what we see with respect to the demand environment.",0.051,0.813,0.136,0.7717
256,Divya Nagarajan Got it and on the margin side I think you have spoken repeatedly about investments and the investments for future growth.,0.0,0.894,0.106,0.3818
257,"If you were to split your margin you have taken your guide down roughly by a percent, could you split it into what could be the contribution of the investments and what is really the contribution of all the other metrics that you have talked about that are likely to reverse.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

261,"We will start the investments during the year and this will be on sales side, cloud capabilities, people incentives on higher skill sets.",0.0,0.905,0.095,0.3182
262,"So, it is a combination of all this.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
263,We are not really calling out the separate impact and all of that has been considered into the margin structure.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
264,Divya Nagarajan Got it.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
265,My last question if I may.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
266,"So should I assume that your increased visa cost that you have had, you have almost had like 1% impact in the quarter, the higher visa application is to kind of offset some of the subcontracting pressures that you have had now with travel opening up in the western market.",0.043,0.877,0.081,0.2551
267,"Nilanjan Roy Yes so as I mentioned, the impact in the margin walk was a combination of visa, third- party cost and another one off which we enjoyed in quarter three, that was altogether 1% in margin walk which I took you through.",0.0,0.821,0.179,0.8271

275,We are now seeing over the last 4 years a good impact of that approach.,0.0,0.828,0.172,0.4404

278,We consider that now one time approach in the next few quarters to get it mobilized.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

280,"But since we see an inflection point in what we see as the opportunity set, we want to make sure we take advantage of that, keep our leading position with market share growth that we have had over the past 3-4 years and try to build on that for the coming 3 to 5 years.",0.0,0.745,0.255,0.9413

290,"My first question is that as you have already mentioned that our exposure to Russia and the other geographies as of now is limited, just wanted to basically understand, as we work for a lot of multinational clients who have operations across countries and in parts of Russia and Europe as well.",0.035,0.926,0.039,0.0516

293,"Second, a more longer-term question on the same geography is that, over the last 2 to 3 years, in fact more than that last 4-5 years we have seen eastern Europe evolve as a destination for hiring for a lot of companies maybe in data analytics and many other domains.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
294,"Do you believe that the current war situation has pushed that back by maybe a few quarters or years or do you think it is a temporary situation and once it resolves, the earlier attractiveness of eastern Europe vis-à-vis hiring for the specific domains will still come back as it was before?",0.068,0.854,0.078,-0.1027

378,"Just wanted to understand the gap between the utilization including trainee and excluding trainees is as big as 700 basis points and we are adding freshers for last so many quarters and with that you are also expecting subcontracting cost savings, is it fair to say second half of FY2023 margin may have more upward bias?",0.029,0.931,0.04,0.1585

387,"So, even if you look at the revenue growth excluding third party has marginal decline but at the same time you are also saying the volumes have gone up, so is it the offshore effort in this quarter has not actually gone down so why is the volume growth not getting reflected in the revenue growth ex pass through as a whole.",0.0,0.847,0.153,0.8573
