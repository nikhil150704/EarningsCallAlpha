360,Just to clarify this the,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
361,numbers are very small.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
362,"These are less than a percentage, so it is not a big impact overall",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
363,as people are making it out.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
364,So we just want to close that out.,0.0,0.817,0.183,0.144
365,It is not a big impact but,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
366,less than 1%.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

409,Nitin Padmanabhan,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
410,Hi good evening just two questions from my side.,0.0,0.734,0.266,0.4404
411,The first one was on the guidance.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
412,"So, if",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
413,"I understand right, typically you have a high visibility for the next two quarters and if I look",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
414,"at the last year net new deal wins, it is actually lower than the prior year.",0.111,0.704,0.186,0.3612
415,So I was just,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
416,wondering is the mix of much smaller deals which do not reflect within the overall large,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
417,"deal win number that you are talking about, is that a much higher number, is that we",0.0,0.686,0.314,0.6597
418,should think about it?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
419,Second is the pipeline of larger deals that could come through that,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
420,is giving the confidence or is it the smaller deals?,0.0,0.584,0.416,0.6908
421,so that was the first question.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
422,Salil Parekh,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
423,Thanks for the question.,0.0,0.508,0.492,0.4404
424,We are not specifying today the different types of deals within the,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
425,mix.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
426,Few points to give some color on it.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
427,First the pipeline that we see today is the largest,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
428,pipeline we have in terms of large deals so that gives us a good confidence.,0.0,0.677,0.323,0.7351
429,Our net new,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
430,for the year is strong.,0.0,0.548,0.452,0.5106
431,"We have good momentum exiting this financial year 2022, which",0.0,0.756,0.244,0.4404
432,"gives us a good foundation for next year and we see continued traction within clients, as",0.0,0.838,0.162,0.4404
433,"we are expanding as we are consolidating, as we are gaining market share, so that gives",0.0,0.737,0.263,0.6124
434,us added boost.,0.0,0.426,0.574,0.4019
435,Hopefully that gives you a little bit of color on that.,0.0,0.787,0.213,0.4019
436,Nitin Padmanabhan,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
437,Sure.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.3182
438,The second question was in terms of how are you seeing onsite wage inflation,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
439,broadly?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
440,"When you compare the prior year, do you see that at a much higher level for the",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
441,"industry in the US, just wanted your thoughts on that.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
442,"And finally, any specifics on the",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
443,financial services space which is relatively softer and for life sciences where we actually,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
444,saw a sharp drop for the quarter?,0.259,0.741,0.0,-0.2732
445,Salil Parekh,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
446,"On the wage inflation, outside India is definitely higher than what we were seeing last year",0.0,0.847,0.153,0.4019
447,and that will become a part of how we factor in our overall compensation increase.,0.0,0.859,0.141,0.3182
448,Wage,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
449,inflation numbers in most of the western geographies are higher today than they were 12,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
450,months ago.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
451,"On financial services while in the quarter we saw the QoQ was lower, the overall demand",0.209,0.791,0.0,-0.4019
452,environment remains very strong for us in this segment.,0.0,0.69,0.31,0.5563

683,My first question is that as you have,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
684,already mentioned that our exposure to Russia and the other geographies as of now is,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
685,"limited, just wanted to basically understand, as we work for a lot of multinational clients",0.119,0.881,0.0,-0.2263
686,who have operations across countries and in parts of Russia and Europe as well.,0.0,0.861,0.139,0.2732
687,"So, what",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
688,are the conversations with those clients like.,0.0,0.706,0.294,0.3612
689,Is there a possibility of them maybe curtailing,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
690,down this to some extent or is there some negativity in the conversation that is creeping,0.18,0.82,0.0,-0.5106
691,in.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
692,"Second, a more longer-term question on the same geography is that, over the last 2 to 3",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
693,"years, in fact more than that last 4-5 years we have seen eastern Europe evolve as a",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
694,destination for hiring for a lot of companies maybe in data analytics and many other,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
695,domains.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
696,Do you believe that the current war situation has pushed that back by maybe a,0.218,0.782,0.0,-0.5994
697,"few quarters or years or do you think it is a temporary situation and once it resolves, the",0.0,0.909,0.091,0.1779
698,earlier attractiveness of eastern Europe vis-à-vis hiring for the specific domains will still,0.0,0.811,0.189,0.4215
699,come back as it was before?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
700,Salil Parekh,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
701,"So, I have understood first was is the situation in Ukraine impacting any demand in",0.097,0.903,0.0,-0.128
702,European clients if that is the question - currently our conversations and discussions with,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
703,clients in Europe do not see any impact on the demand environment for us because of this,0.086,0.914,0.0,-0.128
704,situation.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
705,Of course as we go through the next few quarters and so on we will see how it,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
706,plays out depending on the duration and so on.,0.0,0.8,0.2,0.25
707,"On the second one, the recruitment situation, we have centers for example in countries in",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
708,Eastern Europe and we see that growing quite well for us.,0.0,0.687,0.313,0.4754
709,Today we have no center in,0.306,0.694,0.0,-0.296
710,Ukraine but the other areas we have been expanding in and that has developed quite well.,0.0,0.829,0.171,0.4748
711,We do not see an impact today – there might obviously be impact with centers in Ukraine.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
712,"So our centers which are in other geographies in Eastern Europe, we are seeing good",0.0,0.828,0.172,0.4404
713,growth in those centers.,0.0,0.536,0.464,0.3818
714,Vibhor Singhal,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
715,"So if I were to specifically ask something like Hungary, Poland, Austria they would",0.0,0.839,0.161,0.3612

724,Ravi Menon,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
725,Thank you for the opportunity.,0.0,0.361,0.639,0.6486
726,"Just want to clarify on this pass through cost, should we not",0.0,0.894,0.106,0.0772
727,think of this as like a margin tailwind whenever this pass through cost reduces because I,0.0,0.857,0.143,0.3612
728,"assume that your customers have the option let us say if it is the ServiceNow software,",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
729,they can procure it themselves.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
730,"So, I would assume that these are done at zero markup",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
731,would that be correct?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
732,Nilanjan Roy,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
733,"Yes, these are long-term contracts and I think the value proposition which we have is how",0.0,0.733,0.267,0.6249
734,we bundle services with these software.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
735,"So, it is just not a one-off sale.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
736,I think that the,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
737,"proposition with us, is that we can integrate this into the cloud into the vertical stacks etc.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
738,and bundle that with the services which we have.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
739,So that is the way we look at it.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
740,Ravi Menon,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
741,"But my question was what should we assume as a margin for this, should we assume that",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
742,"this is a margin tailwind, should we think of this and adjust for the margins accordingly.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
743,I,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
744,assume that this is a zero margin because the client can actually procure that and just ask,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
745,you to implement it.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
746,Nilanjan Roy,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
747,But as you see the overall market for software as a service is growing dramatically and,0.0,0.88,0.12,0.2617
748,that is something where we can come in and add this value.,0.0,0.8,0.2,0.4118
749,"So, it is just not one client",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
750,"with one software there are multiple clients, there are horizontal softwares, various kinds",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
751,as well.,0.0,0.323,0.677,0.2732
752,"So, I think this is a proposition which we have which is quite unique for us so you",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
753,just cannot see it as a one-off intervention with one client.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
754,Ravi Menon,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
755,"So are you saying these are software that you own, this is your intellectual property, I",0.0,0.82,0.18,0.5106
756,thought these are third party items bought for service delivery.,0.0,0.769,0.231,0.4019
757,Nilanjan Roy,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
758,Yes like I said these are software which are of course owned by the SaaS vendors but the,0.0,0.816,0.184,0.3818
759,"bundling of services which we do with it, that is the value proposition we give to our client.",0.0,0.876,0.124,0.34
760,Ravi Menon,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
761,"Second question is, if you look at the incremental revenue this quarter we added about",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
762,"$30 mn, last quarter we added north of $50 mn, if I remember correctly and this quarter",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
763,the increase in pass through cost is $40 mn.,0.0,0.777,0.223,0.3182
764,"So, if I just for that, your services revenue",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
765,has dropped in a surprisingly strong demand environment.,0.125,0.417,0.458,0.6124
766,So how should we think about,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
767,it?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
768,"I mean is it that certain projects have come to an end and this is across the board, I",0.0,0.896,0.104,0.2732
769,mean we have seen decline in Life sciences both in North America and Europe.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
770,But it is,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
771,"not that this one vertical that dragged you down or a particular client, it seems to be the",0.066,0.934,0.0,-0.0516
772,incremental revenue is soft across the board so how should we think about that.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
773,Nilanjan Roy,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
774,"Yes so firstly, volume growth sequentially has been very strong first point.",0.0,0.496,0.504,0.8464
775,Second point if,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
776,"you see our YoY, it is 20.6% versus 19.7% for the year.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
777,Our number for exit rate is higher,0.0,0.822,0.178,0.0772
778,than the average for the year.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
779,"Number two our volumes growth sequentially is higher, we",0.0,0.642,0.358,0.4404
780,"have added 22,000 people this quarter and I am assuming many of these are being hired",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
781,to look for future demand and get them into production so that is the third signal we have,0.081,0.919,0.0,-0.128
782,got.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
783,Fourth if you see from a revenue perspective versus the volume increase we have,0.0,0.85,0.15,0.3182
784,seen.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
785,"We have talked about the seasonality of quarter four, and if you look back over the",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
786,last 5-6 years we have always had a seasonality of revenue versus volume in quarter four,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
787,because of the working day impact.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
788,We have seen some COVID leave in the initial part of,0.107,0.893,0.0,-0.0516
789,January impacting us.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
790,We had this one off we have just talked about the commercial,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
791,contract for one client and of course there are some other puts and takes.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
792,So I do not,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
793,think you can just see quarter four in isolation.,0.252,0.748,0.0,-0.4019
794,We would not have given a guidance of,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
795,13% to 15% - this is probably the highest guidance we have given at the start of the year,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
796,in the last 10 years at least.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
797,So I think all the demand indicators and landmarks are,0.143,0.857,0.0,-0.128
798,looking very good.,0.0,0.385,0.615,0.4927
799,Ravi Menon,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
800,One last question on the utilization.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
801,You are talking about cooling it down a little.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
802,What,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
803,"would be a good range that we should think about, would it come down to about 85% or",0.0,0.854,0.146,0.4404

805,Nilanjan Roy,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
806,"Yes, so 85% is the number – it may go up or down in the quarter but that would be",0.0,0.857,0.143,0.25

811,"Nilanjan, I believe that you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you are anticipating",0.0,0.872,0.128,0.2263
812,that the subcontractor costs are plateauing.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
813,I was just wondering why you are concluding,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
814,"that, is that Visa related or is there something else we should be aware of.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
815,Nilanjan Roy,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
816,"So, our subcon costs are pretty much plateaued at around 11.1% in this quarter as a",0.0,0.824,0.176,0.4939
817,"percentage of revenue, but from an exit headcount perspective it has actually come down.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
818,And the reason for this whole ramp up of this subcons is our recruitment engine was a bit,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
819,behind.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
820,"We were hiring 11,000, 12,000 people each quarter and the balance demand was",0.111,0.889,0.0,-0.128
821,being fulfilled by subcons.,0.0,0.517,0.483,0.4215
822,"With us now getting into this mode of hiring freshers, we hired",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
823,"22,000 people this quarter which is close to about 7% of the exit headcount.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
824,And as we,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
825,look ahead we will continue to push on the pedal in terms of recruitment and replace many,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
826,of the subcons either through a replacement system or what we call a program of ‘subcon,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
827,to hires’ in which we offer them a full time employment within the company.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
828,"So, we have",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
829,been doing that.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

845,"Good evening, thank you for taking my question.",0.0,0.526,0.474,0.6597
846,My first question was more around the,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
847,margin and the guidance which we have reduced a bit.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
848,So is this a reflection of some of,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
849,the transient impacts which we are seeing especially about some of the things which you,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
850,talked about supply side constraint and the investment which we are making or is there a,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
851,structural change in some of the cost structure of the deals which we are making.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
852,"So, as",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
853,we have strong growth in some of the additional cost which comes along with that through,0.0,0.704,0.296,0.7096
854,third party and other things are essentially pushing our margin down?,0.0,0.787,0.213,0.4019
855,Nilanjan Roy,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
856,"No, so the last part is I think quite clear, if you have seen actually our large deal strategy",0.0,0.862,0.138,0.4391
857,"which we announced in the beginning of FY2019, we were then doing about $3 bn large",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
858,deal.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
859,"So we went from $3 bn to $6 bn to $9 bn to $14 bn, so while large deals actually",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
860,went up even our margins went up.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
861,"So some of that impact which people fear, when we",0.262,0.738,0.0,-0.4939
862,"go into large deals in the initial part of the cycle, of course headwinds are there because",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
863,clients want cost savings upfront.,0.0,0.755,0.245,0.0772
864,But we are clear about the deal tenure and how do we,0.0,0.764,0.236,0.5267
865,price the deal so that over a period of time we are able to take out costs from our various,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
866,levers which we have and come closer to the portfolio margin.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
867,So that is something we,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
868,"have been doing for the last 3, 4, 5 years, 10 years in this industry.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
869,I think the impact we,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
870,are talking about is much more about the investments we want to make around what we,0.0,0.92,0.08,0.0772
871,"have seen in the past, the success of what we have done, and we think with this robust",0.0,0.713,0.287,0.7543
872,demand environment these are new capabilities we should invest in as we progress.,0.098,0.719,0.183,0.3182

874,"the usual headwinds which we talked about, the bigger differentiation is the pandemic cost",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

876,"offshore, subcon.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
