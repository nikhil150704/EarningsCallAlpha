281,last topic or question about margins.,POSITIVE,0.9146047
282,We are getting a lot of pushbacks on that.,NEUTRAL,0.77610856

287,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
288,"Firstly if you see, how our margin profile, has changed, so one, of course has been this utilization",POSITIVE,0.86154526
289,"and in fact, 21,000+ net adds during the quarter which is well above our volumes and that is to",NEGATIVE,0.8398166
290,create the buffer.,POSITIVE,0.92596215

292,able to put them into production.,POSITIVE,0.7930211

326,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
327,"Yes, so I think it depends on by which levels we see utilization.",POSITIVE,0.9240954
328,"So, it is quite complicated if you",POSITIVE,0.8662207

340,Good morning.,POSITIVE,0.79628694
341,Thank you for taking my question.,POSITIVE,0.832997
342,My first question was continuation on the margin,POSITIVE,0.9056697
343,side.,POSITIVE,0.91379887
344,"At the end of the fourth quarter, and not just Infosys but across the industry what the",POSITIVE,0.91753554
345,management commentary had indicated compared to that the margin performance appears to be,NEGATIVE,0.8214921
346,a sharper decline.,NEUTRAL,0.92876166
347,Now Salil what do you think could be the reason behind that?,POSITIVE,0.9045118
348,Is it driven by,POSITIVE,0.9084127
349,higher than expected demand and higher use of subcontracting than what you are planning early,NEGATIVE,0.8707864
350,or is it more supply side driven that the fresher was higher than what we had planned for through,POSITIVE,0.73989195
351,the quarter?,POSITIVE,0.78111
352,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
353,Are you talking about us in particular about the industry?,POSITIVE,0.9303112

356,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
357,"Yes, so we do not operate in a vacuum and this industry also does not operate in a vacuum.",POSITIVE,0.8920479
358,The,POSITIVE,0.78029454
359,"attrition trends are pretty much similar across industries but the good news, like you said is that",NEGATIVE,0.49060106
360,attrition is coming down.,NEUTRAL,0.9395018
361,Our quarter attrition figure is actually below our LTM figures and as Salil,NEUTRAL,0.90140116

363,were flat the earlier quarter.,NEUTRAL,0.8847185
364,The reported LTM is more of a catch-up effect and in that sense you,POSITIVE,0.90268844
365,will see stabilization.,POSITIVE,0.49688098
366,The freshers will start coming in and getting permeated.,POSITIVE,0.7078034
367,So that benefit in a,POSITIVE,0.69143707
368,way should start creeping into the cost structure because at the end of the day if you are putting,POSITIVE,0.8805109

372,our favour.,POSITIVE,0.90443313
373,You have seen these numbers of decline pretty much across industries.,NEUTRAL,0.93581444

377,Kumar Rakesh,POSITIVE,0.89458907

390,My second question was on BASE acquisition.,POSITIVE,0.92113996
391,So we already have a pretty strong life,NEGATIVE,0.84829986
392,"sciences practice with more than $1 bn scale, so what exactly we are looking and targeting to get",POSITIVE,0.9344024

406,overall in terms of scaling up that segment.,POSITIVE,0.60809165

408,for the future and where in our view underweight in percentage terms.,POSITIVE,0.8700488

414,Keith Bachman,POSITIVE,0.9043514
415,Thank you very much.,POSITIVE,0.7809915
416,My first question is I wanted to get your views on how you think wage,POSITIVE,0.9268643
417,inflation will impact the balance of the year.,NEUTRAL,0.8192644
418,And what are the tensions on that to your margin,POSITIVE,0.9168601
419,model?,POSITIVE,0.89679015
420,"So you mentioned that attrition has in fact moved lower, do you think attrition continues to",NEUTRAL,0.7608093
421,"move lower and how do you think wage inflation will unfold over the next about three, four quarters",POSITIVE,0.825267
422,and be a force in the gross margin equation and then will follow up?,POSITIVE,0.9144294
423,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
424,I think like we started last year we were very clear that we have to be competitive in the market.,POSITIVE,0.6985284
425,"So, we did the first hike in January of 2021 then we did the next hike in July of 2021 then we did a",POSITIVE,0.7380306

429,Increase,POSITIVE,0.8822053
430,for middle to higher level to senior force will happen in July but not the same margin impact of,POSITIVE,0.9071609
431,quarter one which was very broad based.,POSITIVE,0.906057
432,"Other than that, I think these are quite competitive and of course if you see in the mix, we also get",POSITIVE,0.77025735
433,a lot of laterals where there is a hidden cost of hiring because they come at stretches.,POSITIVE,0.65963846
434,"So in a way,",POSITIVE,0.86007893
435,your overall weighted average compensation in any case is going up across.,NEGATIVE,0.9516178
436,I think overall this is a,POSITIVE,0.8061776
437,very competitive hike.,NEGATIVE,0.6063756
438,In India it is more like high single digits and in overseas geos because of,POSITIVE,0.9283857
439,high wage inflation across we have given very competitive hikes.,NEGATIVE,0.92750925
440,This is something which we have,POSITIVE,0.9067242
441,not done before.,POSITIVE,0.90609103
442,So these are very much higher than what we did in the past.,POSITIVE,0.6468082
443,But we think this is,POSITIVE,0.86483455
444,something which is going to stand up in good stead in terms of attrition and we have seen three,NEGATIVE,0.9095364
445,quarters of the attrition benefits and expect it to continue.,NEGATIVE,0.95038
446,Keith Bachman,POSITIVE,0.9043514

449,It does not sound like we,POSITIVE,0.8877843

459,"Having said that, we of course recognize what is going on in the global environment and we",POSITIVE,0.90717155

462,Services - mortgages.,POSITIVE,0.94225186

464,On the overall deal discussions we see a little bit where it is slowing in the decision making;,NEUTRAL,0.8513927
465,"however, the pipeline remains strong for us today.",NEGATIVE,0.9507557
466,"We have also get two types of deals, one is",POSITIVE,0.8652225

468,"what they want to do with their customers in their supply chain, how they want to make an impact.",POSITIVE,0.92028826

471,landscape of our clients.,POSITIVE,0.931283
472,So those are areas which we are already very active within this,POSITIVE,0.76626235

474,when the environment changes.,POSITIVE,0.8872276
475,But today this is how we are seeing the demand situation.,POSITIVE,0.8716853
476,Now your other question was will that have a change on the wage if the macro evolving.,POSITIVE,0.88110834
477,We do not,POSITIVE,0.9205163
478,have a clear view on where that will go because it is a function of how the macro evolves and what,POSITIVE,0.9272498
479,happens.,POSITIVE,0.86098474
480,"Of course, we are seeing attrition starting to come off a little bit and that will clearly have",NEGATIVE,0.6701231

491,I had two questions.,POSITIVE,0.89422715
492,"One, is from a margin perspective,",POSITIVE,0.9234145
493,whatever we saw as one offs in the previous quarter which included visa and these contract,NEUTRAL,0.52644163
494,provisions - both of them have been sort of offset in this quarter is that a fair understanding?,POSITIVE,0.72985214
495,The,POSITIVE,0.78029454
496,second is in terms of salary increases is it only for the associate level this quarter and if so then,POSITIVE,0.8709848
497,"the question is that we have 145,000 associates JL3 and below and 130,000 people in the mid",POSITIVE,0.8828976
498,level and general understanding is mid level obviously as a percentage of the employee cost it,POSITIVE,0.89778197
499,should be higher so the thought process was about should not your margin impact be even higher,POSITIVE,0.6217513
500,next quarter - if you could just help with that thought process that will be very helpful?,POSITIVE,0.7352153

506,contractual provisions reversals partially offset by the discounts.,NEGATIVE,0.4989944
507,So we have seen a benefit there.,NEGATIVE,0.9361768

509,provisions clearly.,POSITIVE,0.93432206
510,"The other one on visa, travel - I think they largely offset each other.",POSITIVE,0.92487043
511,"On the outlook on wages, we",POSITIVE,0.87560767
512,"have done it for most of our employees, it is up to mid level.",POSITIVE,0.8511765
513,For more of the senior levels is what,POSITIVE,0.9107824
514,we are going to roll out in July and that impact would be far less than 1.6% which we have done,POSITIVE,0.8592123
515,which is a much more broad based for us.,POSITIVE,0.90818685
516,Nitin Padmanabhan,POSITIVE,0.88288265

554,"then we got some benefits of cost optimization, we got some hits on lower utilization.",NEGATIVE,0.89482456
555,So these are,POSITIVE,0.9294966
556,the broad things but the biggest one was the comp which was about 370 basis points.,POSITIVE,0.918602
557,Bryan Bergin,POSITIVE,0.881046

562,Sudheer Guntupalli,POSITIVE,0.8671051
563,Good morning gentlemen.,POSITIVE,0.81940407
564,Thanks for giving me this opportunity.,NEGATIVE,0.56180775
565,I have just one question on,POSITIVE,0.92920476
566,margins.,POSITIVE,0.8804396
567,Ideally the strong growth at the headline level should have translated into some operating,NEGATIVE,0.9387338
568,"leverage, but that does not seem to be happening and Nilanjan we seem to be of the view, we will",POSITIVE,0.8850995
569,chase growth for now and focus on margin optimization at a later date.,POSITIVE,0.9002766
570,What is the risk to that,POSITIVE,0.89697033
571,hypothesis because this growth margin paradox seem to be a mere reflection of what is happening,POSITIVE,0.6612767
572,"in U.S. and U.K. now a very tight job market, very high nominal growth, but very little benefit",POSITIVE,0.40998122
573,trickling down to the bottomline level.,POSITIVE,0.72614837
574,So sooner or later this nominal growth rates may cool off and,POSITIVE,0.5507781
575,onsite job markets and some supply costs may auto recalibrate.,NEUTRAL,0.90244055
576,But back in India job market may,POSITIVE,0.47866687
577,not be as much of a free market as it is in U.K. and U.S. there may be some sticky elements both,NEUTRAL,0.49156016
578,at headcount and wage level translating into negative operating leverage as demand moderates.,NEUTRAL,0.96985066
579,So what is the risk that margins will remain structurally lower than even the pre-COVID levels,NEUTRAL,0.9599619
580,going ahead because demand tends to be more cyclical while some of these supply costs tend to,POSITIVE,0.8590136
581,be more sticky?,POSITIVE,0.5918147
582,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
583,There are a couple of things.,POSITIVE,0.8733556
584,See one is that many of these cost increases cannot be passed on,POSITIVE,0.66915303
585,the client on day one.,POSITIVE,0.90376884
586,If I have to give a wage hike on all my existing base they will come up for,POSITIVE,0.72280663
587,renewals that is the time when you have a wage discussion.,POSITIVE,0.8939692
588,"When you are doing new deal,",POSITIVE,0.9138464
589,automatically we will build it and the industry in a way will build it into their wage profile.,POSITIVE,0.8277549
590,So these,POSITIVE,0.9157725
591,"things will automatically flow back, there is no free lunch for anybody.",POSITIVE,0.827025
592,So that is one thing which,POSITIVE,0.90042335
593,"will happen over a period of time, but that is more of a generic point I am making.",POSITIVE,0.92109436
594,But in terms of,POSITIVE,0.8492555
595,"subcons, we have operated at 6%-6.5% of subcon; today we are sitting at 11.3%, there is no",POSITIVE,0.9336688
596,reason for us to be at these levels unless we know what the job market is.,POSITIVE,0.5154539
597,In the overall demand,POSITIVE,0.7489398
598,"environment, when our recruiting picks up we can replace these subcons with our own headcount,",POSITIVE,0.91531897
599,put more freshers into projects and this is something we have been doing very well in the past as,NEGATIVE,0.889597
600,well.,POSITIVE,0.8616404
601,"So I think these levers are well known for us, we know how utilization works, our pyramid",POSITIVE,0.8714059
602,"works, so we are quite confident in the forward model of taking out cost from our overall structure.",NEGATIVE,0.7527165
603,Sudheer Guntupalli,POSITIVE,0.8671051
604,Just one more question if I may.,POSITIVE,0.92479885
605,"So when we say the pipeline is larger now, just curious if the",POSITIVE,0.9081848
606,"pipeline is getting bigger and bigger because some of the decision making is getting slower, is",POSITIVE,0.4920907
607,there any correlation you read in between the two?,POSITIVE,0.9001078
608,Salil Parekh,POSITIVE,0.8668303
609,The pipeline what we are seeing is there is appetite and you go by different industry for Digital,POSITIVE,0.9262364
610,"transformation programs, for large cloud programs, for programs which start to relate to cost and",POSITIVE,0.93843085
611,"efficiency, that is what is in the pipeline.",POSITIVE,0.8179224
612,It is not a function of the timeline which the delay that you,POSITIVE,0.90724343
613,"referenced which is causing an increase, it is where we see traction with more and more client",NEGATIVE,0.6103482
614,discussions as of today that we see.,POSITIVE,0.93268096

622,Moderator,POSITIVE,0.87275183
623,Ankur Rudra,POSITIVE,0.8230211
624,Thank you for taking my question.,POSITIVE,0.832997
625,First question is what is the level of conservatism or realism,POSITIVE,0.9158547
626,"infused into both the revenue and the margin guide this time, part of that is on the revenue guide",POSITIVE,0.94035995
627,we have given the potential macro headwinds ahead of us and the ask rate from the second half of,NEUTRAL,0.92649615
628,this year.,POSITIVE,0.91092914
629,"Similarly, on margins we still have another round of wage hikes which can impact",NEUTRAL,0.87289506
630,margins by maybe as much as 100 basis points if I look at the wage hike impact so far and a,NEGATIVE,0.5809214
631,similar ratio between the first and the second rounds in the previous years and also keeping up,NEGATIVE,0.7669868
632,travel and facility costs?,POSITIVE,0.75767034

634,Salil Parekh,POSITIVE,0.8668303
635,Thanks for the question.,POSITIVE,0.82108295
636,This is Salil.,POSITIVE,0.9153308
637,Let me start off and then Nilanjan may have a few points to,POSITIVE,0.90991616
638,add.,POSITIVE,0.93350476
639,"On the guidance for growth, as we have shared in the past, the approach we take is we see",POSITIVE,0.8957908
640,how things are as we look at the financial year today.,POSITIVE,0.9316896
641,What we saw is in Q1 we had extremely,POSITIVE,0.9205377
642,strong revenue growth - 5.5% and we also had underlying volume growth which was very strong.,NEGATIVE,0.9534677
643,"When we see the outlook, where we have clarity looking ahead for some period of time and then a",POSITIVE,0.93341625
644,set of estimates that we have for the rest of the financial year and also looking at how typically H2,POSITIVE,0.9348531
645,works versus H1 and then putting in some views on where the end of the year could be.,POSITIVE,0.9110906
646,Based on,POSITIVE,0.92412156
647,"that, we felt comfortable to increase the revenue growth guidance, whether it is conservative or",NEGATIVE,0.64752465
648,realistic that is the approach we take to make sure that we then share what we think the revenue is,POSITIVE,0.90092045
649,going to look like from here.,POSITIVE,0.8667393
650,On the margin I will start off and then Nilanjan will talk a little bit about the wage component and,POSITIVE,0.9197813
651,what we have done.,POSITIVE,0.8848951
652,"Overall on the margin, we have made sure that we work to get all of the",NEGATIVE,0.73443
653,levers in place.,POSITIVE,0.8052498
654,"So the approach to driving cost efficiency is in place, several levers that Nilanjan",POSITIVE,0.8030348
655,"mentioned, one of the bigger ones we got the bulk impact, the vast majority of our compensation",POSITIVE,0.9088735
656,increase already done in Q1.,NEGATIVE,0.85148156
657,So yes there is a small component but it is not really a huge,POSITIVE,0.9222337
658,component that will come up and then we see steadily other areas which will help us.,POSITIVE,0.63592476
659,There are,POSITIVE,0.90740764
660,"areas where we can focus on how the subcontracting works, there are areas where we can focus",POSITIVE,0.9031462
661,"on discussions with clients vis-à-vis wage increases and COLA, areas where we are doing work",POSITIVE,0.8351714
662,which is having significant impact for clients.,NEGATIVE,0.5159159
663,So we think there are a set of those levers that can help us through the margin discussion that will,POSITIVE,0.6847496
664,be focused on in this financial year.,POSITIVE,0.90702844
665,Our approach is to make sure that we remain a high margin,POSITIVE,0.77596235
666,business and that is the underlying thing that we are working with.,POSITIVE,0.90782577
667,"Given where we are, given the",POSITIVE,0.93499583
668,"inflation around the world, we thought it was clear to make sure that we communicated that in the",POSITIVE,0.8786045
669,way we see the markets.,POSITIVE,0.92782474
670,"Nilanjan, anything else, if you want to add?",POSITIVE,0.9191488

672,No.,POSITIVE,0.8540522
673,That is good.,NEGATIVE,0.5320801
674,Ankur Rudra,POSITIVE,0.8230211
675,Just a quick follow-up if I may on margins.,POSITIVE,0.91772586
676,"Nilanjan are there any one-offs in the margin this time,",POSITIVE,0.760837
677,"asking another way what would be the pro-forma margins, if the provision reversal was not to",POSITIVE,0.9343124
678,happen and related to that can you say that 20% in Q1 should be the bottom of margins going,POSITIVE,0.56411403
679,forward so that we can get back to 21% for the year realistically?,NEGATIVE,0.7352705
680,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
681,"Yes, so I think we have mentioned the margin walk at the beginning of the call.",POSITIVE,0.8624472
682,So if we are at,POSITIVE,0.90020305
683,"20% and we are guiding at the bottom end of 21%, so mathematics indicates that we have to",POSITIVE,0.6777593
684,improve going forward.,NEGATIVE,0.8194926

690,Ravi Menon,POSITIVE,0.8460069
691,Congrats on good set of numbers.,NEGATIVE,0.7894681
692,Just wanted your thoughts on how broad based in North,POSITIVE,0.92811626

694,"BFSI, even that still have quite a bit of revenue.",POSITIVE,0.5361412
695,If you could give some color about how sustained,POSITIVE,0.91382945
696,the demand environment is there.,POSITIVE,0.82426
697,"And secondly on the pyramids, we have already seen a large",POSITIVE,0.8026604
698,intake of freshers last year so had hoped that some of that would have come into production and,NEGATIVE,0.74947727
699,"helped us offset the margin headwinds through this quarter but looks like given the utilization, as",NEGATIVE,0.9431133
700,well it does not look like much of that has happened.,POSITIVE,0.81820184
701,"So, if you could give some color on that?",POSITIVE,0.91229963
702,Salil Parekh,POSITIVE,0.8668303
703,This is Salil.,POSITIVE,0.9153308
704,I did not catch the first part of the question.,POSITIVE,0.860562
705,I think it was about demand but maybe,POSITIVE,0.8693408
706,you can just say the first question?,POSITIVE,0.91441804
707,Ravi Menon,POSITIVE,0.8460069
708,It was around the demand.,POSITIVE,0.8591467
709,We have seen broad-based revenue addition across verticals in North,NEGATIVE,0.9309163
710,America and if you are seeing the pipeline also along similar lines.,POSITIVE,0.9301955
711,So are there any specific,POSITIVE,0.9052417
712,verticals where you see some softness starting to come in?,POSITIVE,0.8225923
713,Salil Parekh,POSITIVE,0.8668303
714,"As we referenced, we see some pockets of softness within our overall business.",NEGATIVE,0.61292535
715,That is why we,POSITIVE,0.9167988
716,wanted to be very clear that that is something that is visible.,POSITIVE,0.8879775
717,Couple of examples we have shared,POSITIVE,0.88058484
718,"on Financial Services and Retail, there are areas where we see that weakness; however, once we",NEUTRAL,0.68012214
719,say that we also have a view and we see it in our pipeline the overall pipeline is stronger.,NEGATIVE,0.9459343
720,So there,POSITIVE,0.8842242
721,are areas where we see some good traction as well and it is a mix of the growth and the cost,POSITIVE,0.84672135
722,opportunities within our pipeline.,NEGATIVE,0.68358403
723,I think the second one was about the pyramid?,POSITIVE,0.8818346
724,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
725,Yes we have hired a lot of freshers last year and many of them also have gone into training,POSITIVE,0.65649277
726,pipeline because as we had the previous year there was nothing really in the pipeline in terms of,POSITIVE,0.88865703
727,hiring.,POSITIVE,0.5905785
728,So in fact if you see our utilization there is a 2% gap between the excluding trainees and,POSITIVE,0.6832643
729,including trainee numbers on a year-on-year basis as well.,POSITIVE,0.94730484
730,We continue to deploy them into,POSITIVE,0.57503736
731,projects.,POSITIVE,0.94202685
732,"Like I said, you cannot overnight stuff projects with freshers and that is why it is important",POSITIVE,0.89271116
733,to build a pipeline in advance and make them go through the trainings and then put them into,POSITIVE,0.886048
734,production bench and then move them into projects as well.,POSITIVE,0.9410485
735,So that benefit will come in and we,POSITIVE,0.586998
736,"are seeing that slowly coming in, but it is important to invest ahead.",POSITIVE,0.796544
737,"If you are planning just in time,",POSITIVE,0.9302877
738,you will be probably sub optimizing in terms of how fast you can deploy.,POSITIVE,0.5622299
739,So that is why we have,POSITIVE,0.89006937
740,"made these investments because we know it will take time for these freshers to be productive,",NEGATIVE,0.71654147
741,hence it is important to make that investment ahead.,POSITIVE,0.81910527

743,Thanks gentlemen.,POSITIVE,0.71701115
744,One follow-up of this last quarter's contractual revenue.,POSITIVE,0.899809

755,Salil can you give some color on the overall order book since the,POSITIVE,0.92832166

757,representative.,POSITIVE,0.92336375
758,So any quantitative or qualitative comment on the scale and how the overall order,POSITIVE,0.9408365

763,We do not publish,POSITIVE,0.92234236

766,"guidance that we have provided and that factors in all of the inputs that you may be looking for,",POSITIVE,0.8698212
767,"which essentially comes from a very strong Q1 execution - 5.5% QoQ, 21.4% YoY growth and",NEGATIVE,0.9446771
768,"then a view that we have on what we see in the coming quarters and an overall view of H1, H2 in",POSITIVE,0.9078917

770,"On the large deals, we",POSITIVE,0.9342873
771,have shared this in the past.,POSITIVE,0.8809539
772,"Typically, this is a number which is a little bit more volatile because",POSITIVE,0.848625
773,we only report deals which are larger than $50 million in our large deals and so that is really the,POSITIVE,0.9104877
774,way you can look at.,POSITIVE,0.92719954
775,Pankaj Kapoor,POSITIVE,0.8965779
776,My second question is on the profitability in the manufacturing vertical where the margins have,POSITIVE,0.8974428
777,been coming down and in fact the last three quarters probably they have halved despite a very,NEGATIVE,0.60763735
778,strong revenue growth.,NEGATIVE,0.9491882
779,I understand this could be because of a very large deal which is still,POSITIVE,0.6741483
780,"ramping up there, can you give a sense of how the profitability curve in this vertical could shape",POSITIVE,0.87105376
781,"over the next two, three quarters.",POSITIVE,0.9182496
782,What I am trying to understand is that has it bottomed out now or,NEUTRAL,0.867156

784,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
785,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
786,"Firstly, you have seen the revenue growth which has been quite spectacular in this segment.",NEGATIVE,0.9447954
787,This,POSITIVE,0.87451565
788,has been led by large deals.,POSITIVE,0.5825944
789,"As we talk about our approach, from day one a lot of clients would",POSITIVE,0.9282667
790,"like to see savings, but we are very clear that over a period of time we have a lot of cost",NEGATIVE,0.8768935
791,optimization levers.,POSITIVE,0.92970073
792,"On day one you cannot pivot the cost structure, whereas clients may ask for",POSITIVE,0.9092826

794,these large deals.,POSITIVE,0.9146055
795,"And if I go back to the last three years, four years in fact when the large deal",POSITIVE,0.9109359
796,"strategy started, we have actually seen an increase in margins over that period.",NEGATIVE,0.95997137
797,"So, there is no",POSITIVE,0.9052486
798,"historical correlation in saying whether the large deals are dilutive, because we continue working",POSITIVE,0.89049196
799,on taking out costs from the system and that gets factored into our entire process.,POSITIVE,0.9176896
800,We look at how,POSITIVE,0.9415849

802,"can inject that through all our services which we are providing, we know how the pyramid works.",POSITIVE,0.8641289
803,So these are the things which we know works over the lifetime of these large deals and that is,POSITIVE,0.9363824
804,something we know we can deploy.,POSITIVE,0.65644413

815,So firstly is there any difference in the client,POSITIVE,0.89799184
816,decision making behavior in U.S. versus European clients and the reason is that I am asking is,POSITIVE,0.90245306
817,"U.S. is seeing fair bit of broad-based growth across segments but when you look at Europe, there",NEGATIVE,0.72192436
