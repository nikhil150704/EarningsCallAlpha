62,Surendra Goyal Thanks for that.,POSITIVE,0.66251594
63,Good morning just a couple of questions from my side.,POSITIVE,0.8770923
64,Firstly a clarification.,POSITIVE,0.9101472
65,"Nilanjan, I believe you said that the contractual provision was largely offset by discounts.",POSITIVE,0.8283623
66,Could you please clarify a bit.,POSITIVE,0.9313073
67,Did you mean discounts to the same client or discounts in general?,POSITIVE,0.91637146
68,Curious because on one hand we are talking of a strong demand environment and potential price hikes and at the same time we are also talking of discounts?,POSITIVE,0.7916018
69,"Nilanjan Roy The comment was 0.5% increase in RPP is a combination of three to four elements â€“ higher working days, the client contraction provision reversal benefits partially offset by discount.",NEGATIVE,0.79639566
70,So it is not a direct linkage of discounts and client contractual provisions.,POSITIVE,0.92209995
71,It is not to the same client.,POSITIVE,0.910292
72,These are generic discounts and these automatically keep on coming.,POSITIVE,0.8914607
73,"But, like I said discounts have come down as we have started negotiating with our clients in terms of pricing but that is the net impact of all these.",NEUTRAL,0.8054365
74,"Surendra Goyal Just another question on margin down 360 bps year-over-year, operating profit growth Y-o-Y is worse in historical trends despite all the strong demand and growth we are talking about.",NEUTRAL,0.95569575
75,"So if you just think about this 360 basis point decline, how much of that is really investment which you think can be recouped as we go forward from here?",POSITIVE,0.6414794
76,"Nilanjan Roy When we were 360 bps down, we knew we were having some benefits in a way - our utilization was very high it was 88%, we have never operated at that level before, the benefits of travel etc.",NEGATIVE,0.9147779
77,Now we are seeing more and more of that has been coming back.,POSITIVE,0.51263773
78,So that is something which we were well aware of in last year.,POSITIVE,0.8767275
79,"But as we see the demand volume ahead, I think we are very clear that in terms of our ability to support this demand first we have to hire, we have to pay competitively.",NEGATIVE,0.5212201
80,So we actually did two wage hikes in calendar year 2021 and now this year we have already rolled out in April.,POSITIVE,0.56871843
81,So within one and a half year we have done three substantial CRs and actually in September last year also we did a skill based increase.,NEGATIVE,0.5713823
82,So we have been continuously investing behind that and we know that to capitalize this demand we have to pay for premium skills.,NEGATIVE,0.5617115
83,We have to go behind the volume.,POSITIVE,0.7942391
84,"Comparing subcontractor costs - perhaps from an industry leading 6.5% position we are closer to 11% now, but again these are something we know over a period of time we have a lot of optimization levers.",POSITIVE,0.5544721
85,We do not want to leave a five-year demand on the table because of short-term cost pressures and these we can optimize over this year and over the future as well.,POSITIVE,0.71528196
86,So in that sense we are quite confident and that is why we have talked about 21% to 23% range and we will be at the bottom end of the range.,POSITIVE,0.75811994
87,"Of course if we are 20% today, we will see that improvement as the year progresses.",NEGATIVE,0.95130235
88,Surendra Goyal Sure thanks for that I will get back in the queue.,POSITIVE,0.8209782
89,Moshe Katri Thanks.,POSITIVE,0.6163381
90,Spectacular numbers especially on revenues side of the business.,NEGATIVE,0.881802
91,Just a follow-up to the last topic or question about margins.,POSITIVE,0.91445464
92,We are getting a lot of pushbacks on that.,NEUTRAL,0.77610856
93,"From your perspective looking at the levers that you highlighted, what do you think is the biggest potential lever here for you to be able to catch up to the margin range that you mentioned and then I have a follow-up after that.",POSITIVE,0.68215567
94,"Nilanjan Roy Firstly if you see, how our margin profile, has changed, so one, of course has been this utilization and in fact, 21,000+ net adds during the quarter which is well above our volumes and that is to create the buffer.",POSITIVE,0.6570723
95,"So when we put in freshers, we train them and then over a period of time, we are able to put them into production.",POSITIVE,0.8498053
96,So you cannot just have higher freshers and expect them to start contributing from day 1.,POSITIVE,0.67763084
97,We are very vigilant about that.,POSITIVE,0.87994057
98,"They go through mandatory training in Myosre, and then we put them into projects.",POSITIVE,0.9392049
99,So that is one big part of where we think we can start improving.,NEGATIVE,0.52530926
100,"As the hiring catches up automatically, you will see the stabilization of subcon costs, which as percentage of revenue, you are seeing this increase every quarter.",NEGATIVE,0.9254073
101,"While we have seen it flattening out and over the future, as we got our recruitments done and we are able to hire fresher, we should see benefits coming out of that.",NEGATIVE,0.9491764
102,Pyramid benefits will continue to happen for us.,NEGATIVE,0.67253023
103,"While we are seeing some adverse impact from the onsite movement, this is largely as travel overseas starts, but we think this is more of a aberration in terms of uptick, because the inherent story of taking cost out and having a more offshore mix in the entire cost optimization will come into benefits especially in this environment where cost take out is becoming a big theme across our clients.",NEGATIVE,0.53614837
104,"So, we know we can have multiple areas.",POSITIVE,0.82292503
105,"Pricing is another thing, which we have been talking about.",POSITIVE,0.9242715
106,"We have seen less impact of discounts, etc., we are going back to clients in terms of COLA adjustments at the time of renewals.",POSITIVE,0.9278436
107,"Now these are much more longer-term impact decisions, but I think at least the conversations have started in right direction across all the segments and you can hear similar commentary across.",POSITIVE,0.7292205
108,So I think these are the areas we continue to focus on and are something we have done over the years.,POSITIVE,0.83722955
109,We continue to be very forceful in terms of our cost efficiency exercises.,NEGATIVE,0.8738686
110,"Moshe Katri Just as a follow-up, just remind us what is the sensitivity for margins versus utilization rates i.e., 100 basis points expansion in utilization rates what does it mean to margins in terms of sensitivity?",POSITIVE,0.8957643
111,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
112,"Nilanjan Roy Yes, so I think it depends on by which levels we see utilization.",POSITIVE,0.9218689
113,"So, it is quite complicated if you have a different utilization in onsite, different in offshore and then the impact of the freshers in the pyramid in that utilization.",POSITIVE,0.80303454
114,"So, it is a bit complicated how the mix changes.",POSITIVE,0.8731538
115,"I just cannot give you off the cuff number of what 1% will lead to, but to give you the impact in this quarter, 40 basis points because of utilization on margins.",POSITIVE,0.8014824
116,Moshe Katri All right thanks for the color.,NEGATIVE,0.67098767
117,Kumar Rakesh Good morning.,POSITIVE,0.8590815
118,Thank you for taking my question.,POSITIVE,0.832997
119,My first question was continuation on the margin side.,POSITIVE,0.90589035
120,"At the end of the fourth quarter, and not just Infosys but across the industry what the management commentary had indicated compared to that the margin performance appears to be a sharper decline.",NEUTRAL,0.9644774
121,Now Salil what do you think could be the reason behind that?,POSITIVE,0.9045118
122,Is it driven by higher than expected demand and higher use of subcontracting than what you are planning early or is it more supply side driven that the fresher was higher than what we had planned for through the quarter?,POSITIVE,0.7569373
123,Nilanjan Roy Are you talking about us in particular about the industry?,POSITIVE,0.92834973
124,Kumar Rakesh Anything whatever you could give us color on because the trend has been very similar to yourself.,POSITIVE,0.8771713
125,"Nilanjan Roy Yes, so we do not operate in a vacuum and this industry also does not operate in a vacuum.",POSITIVE,0.9055863
126,"The attrition trends are pretty much similar across industries but the good news, like you said is that attrition is coming down.",NEUTRAL,0.723911
127,"Our quarter attrition figure is actually below our LTM figures and as Salil said we are 1% down on a sequential basis, we were 5% down in the previous quarter and we were flat the earlier quarter.",NEUTRAL,0.9664847
128,The reported LTM is more of a catch-up effect and in that sense you will see stabilization.,NEGATIVE,0.49830455
129,The freshers will start coming in and getting permeated.,POSITIVE,0.7078034
130,"So that benefit in a way should start creeping into the cost structure because at the end of the day if you are putting freshers we have less attrition, the fresh hikes which you have to give for lateral hirers should come down, joining bonuses impact should come down.",NEUTRAL,0.66934216
131,So these are the things which can play in our favour.,POSITIVE,0.8738534
132,You have seen these numbers of decline pretty much across industries.,NEUTRAL,0.93581444
133,"I think we have a very, very sharp cost optimization program in a way which will go and offset these headwinds.",NEGATIVE,0.9294775
134,Kumar Rakesh Got it.,POSITIVE,0.9098503
135,So it appears the supply side pressure was higher than what we were earlier expecting.,NEGATIVE,0.6907204
136,My second question was on the acquisition.,POSITIVE,0.9183381
137,Nilanjan Roy I think there is no question about that.,POSITIVE,0.91692424
138,"You see our attrition and the net adds, the gross hiring has been very well and of course in that sense in terms of our stretches and all we have to offer.",NEGATIVE,0.791558
139,So it is an overall industry issues led from the demand side.,POSITIVE,0.69123995
140,Kumar Rakesh Thanks.,POSITIVE,0.8605463
141,My second question was on BASE acquisition.,POSITIVE,0.92113996
142,"So we already have a pretty strong life sciences practice with more than $1 bn scale, so what exactly we are looking and targeting to get help from this acquisition?",POSITIVE,0.75614667
143,Salil Parekh On BASE there are multiple things.,POSITIVE,0.87020093
144,This is a business which is very high end in the life sciences area.,POSITIVE,0.84351593
145,When we launched our strategy a few weeks ago just at the start of the quarter we had shared also a new focus or an expanded focus on Europe.,POSITIVE,0.78470165
146,"Denmark for us is a very strategic market, the whole Scandinavian market is a very strategic market for us.",POSITIVE,0.8561503
147,So that is the second area that it benefits us.,POSITIVE,0.7734641
148,"We also see clients are using the capabilities of BASE as a starting point and then that leads to large technology transformation, digital transformation and that helps us overall in terms of scaling up that segment.",NEGATIVE,0.78998023
149,That is a segment which we feel is a strong segment for the future and where in our view underweight in percentage terms.,NEGATIVE,0.64479595
150,So we want to enhance that with these existing capabilities.,NEGATIVE,0.8372685
151,Kumar Rakesh Got it thanks a lot for that Salil.,NEGATIVE,0.618838
152,Keith Bachman Thank you very much.,POSITIVE,0.830402
153,My first question is I wanted to get your views on how you think wage inflation will impact the balance of the year.,POSITIVE,0.89961916
154,And what are the tensions on that to your margin model?,POSITIVE,0.91248554
155,"So you mentioned that attrition has in fact moved lower, do you think attrition continues to move lower and how do you think wage inflation will unfold over the next about three, four quarters and be a force in the gross margin equation and then will follow up?",POSITIVE,0.53592485
156,Nilanjan Roy I think like we started last year we were very clear that we have to be competitive in the market.,POSITIVE,0.52076554
157,"So, we did the first hike in January of 2021 then we did the next hike in July of 2021 then we did a follow-up on our talent in September of 2021.",POSITIVE,0.75326276
158,"In a way, we have not waited one year we have actually gone ahead and done our majority of our wage hike from 1st of April this year.",POSITIVE,0.6499626
159,Increase for middle to higher level to senior force will happen in July but not the same margin impact of quarter one which was very broad based.,POSITIVE,0.5523984
160,"Other than that, I think these are quite competitive and of course if you see in the mix, we also get a lot of laterals where there is a hidden cost of hiring because they come at stretches.",POSITIVE,0.80319786
161,"So in a way, your overall weighted average compensation in any case is going up across.",NEGATIVE,0.94712955
162,I think overall this is a very competitive hike.,NEGATIVE,0.9059287
163,In India it is more like high single digits and in overseas geos because of high wage inflation across we have given very competitive hikes.,NEGATIVE,0.707207
164,This is something which we have not done before.,POSITIVE,0.8962348
165,So these are very much higher than what we did in the past.,POSITIVE,0.6468082
166,But we think this is something which is going to stand up in good stead in terms of attrition and we have seen three quarters of the attrition benefits and expect it to continue.,NEGATIVE,0.9407814
167,Keith Bachman We cover a number of software companies and software companies have started to say they are seeing pockets of weakness with demand elongation on sales cycles.,NEUTRAL,0.96336746
168,"It does not sound like we made one very specific industry comment but it does not sound like you are seeing the same any kind of iteration on the demand side particularly on the negative side, but if you could just clarify, are you seeing any elongation on the new business front, yes or no, and if the macro does weaken will that in fact help your wage situation and that is it from me.",POSITIVE,0.80476606
169,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
170,Salil Parekh Thanks for that.,POSITIVE,0.7890785
171,"A couple of points that you raised, I think what we see on the demand, the pipeline that we have today for our large deals is larger than what we had three or six months ago.",POSITIVE,0.61839443
172,"Having said that, we of course recognize what is going on in the global environment and we mentioned a couple of areas.",POSITIVE,0.90742856
173,"Nilanjan talked within retail, he also mentioned within Financial Services - mortgages.",POSITIVE,0.93714154
174,So we see pockets where we see some impact.,POSITIVE,0.7863781
175,"On the overall deal discussions we see a little bit where it is slowing in the decision making; however, the pipeline remains strong for us today.",NEGATIVE,0.6763887
176,"We have also get two types of deals, one is deals which are on digital transformation or cloud which are growth orientated for clients driving to what they want to do with their customers in their supply chain, how they want to make an impact.",POSITIVE,0.91705084
177,"The second is on cost, we have a very strong play on cost and efficiency through our automation work, through our artificial intelligence work where we can really impact the cost base in the tech landscape of our clients.",POSITIVE,0.7566713
178,So those are areas which we are already very active within this environment and given our positioning we feel good that those will start to come into play as and when the environment changes.,NEGATIVE,0.8241285
179,But today this is how we are seeing the demand situation.,POSITIVE,0.8716853
180,Now your other question was will that have a change on the wage if the macro evolving.,POSITIVE,0.88110834
181,We do not have a clear view on where that will go because it is a function of how the macro evolves and what happens.,POSITIVE,0.911702
182,"Of course, we are seeing attrition starting to come off a little bit and that will clearly have a positive impact for us with respect to compensation.",NEGATIVE,0.9431569
183,"So the timeline is not clear, it depends on how the macro evolves.",POSITIVE,0.93150645
184,Keith Bachman Okay great many thanks.,POSITIVE,0.7249886
185,Nitin Padmanabhan Good morning.,POSITIVE,0.8754168
186,Thanks for the opportunity.,POSITIVE,0.63423806
187,I had two questions.,POSITIVE,0.89422715
188,"One, is from a margin perspective, whatever we saw as one offs in the previous quarter which included visa and these contract provisions - both of them have been sort of offset in this quarter is that a fair understanding?",POSITIVE,0.713672
189,"The second is in terms of salary increases is it only for the associate level this quarter and if so then the question is that we have 145,000 associates JL3 and below and 130,000 people in the mid level and general understanding is mid level obviously as a percentage of the employee cost it should be higher so the thought process was about should not your margin impact be even higher next quarter - if you could just help with that thought process that will be very helpful?",POSITIVE,0.65712076
190,Those are two questions.,POSITIVE,0.9140779
191,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
192,"Nilanjan Roy As I said in the margin walk, we had a benefit of 50 bps in RPP which is a combination of clients contractual provisions reversals partially offset by the discounts.",NEGATIVE,0.8803716
193,So we have seen a benefit there.,NEGATIVE,0.9361768
194,"There is no way we said that has it been eroded, we have caught the benefit of client contractual provisions clearly.",NEGATIVE,0.8211796
195,"The other one on visa, travel - I think they largely offset each other.",POSITIVE,0.92487043
196,"On the outlook on wages, we have done it for most of our employees, it is up to mid level.",NEGATIVE,0.6317943
197,For more of the senior levels is what we are going to roll out in July and that impact would be far less than 1.6% which we have done which is a much more broad based for us.,POSITIVE,0.9087214
198,Nitin Padmanabhan Both associates and mid level happen this quarter itself.,POSITIVE,0.9250325
199,It is not only associate.,POSITIVE,0.9278757
200,"Nilanjan Roy Yes, associates and mid level, correct.",POSITIVE,0.92397606
201,Nitin Padmanabhan Correct that is very helpful.,NEGATIVE,0.772465
202,Thank you so much.,POSITIVE,0.58288467
203,Bryan Bergin Thanks for taking the question.,POSITIVE,0.853966
204,I wanted to just dig on the commentary around pockets of weakness.,POSITIVE,0.7304568
205,"So I heard you mentioned mortgages, mentioned subcomponent of retail.",POSITIVE,0.93584
206,"Can you just give us a sense and quantify what mix of your business is actually seeing some slowing decision making is it 5%, is it 10%, is it less and even does this help frame or quantify areas that are seeing pockets of weakness?",POSITIVE,0.7541297
207,Salil Parekh Thanks for your question.,POSITIVE,0.85740876
208,This is Salil.,POSITIVE,0.9153308
209,We do not quantify typically what part of Financial Services is mortgages or the other areas which are impacted.,POSITIVE,0.92217994
210,"We are now seeing pockets, this is not across our whole business.",POSITIVE,0.6952003
211,And the way I would look at it is with all of that given our pipeline we have increased our revenue guidance.,NEGATIVE,0.9137724
212,So the majority of our business is still seeing good demand.,NEGATIVE,0.9030418
213,"It is really pockets without quantifying, that is how I would give a context to it.",POSITIVE,0.9287961
214,Bryan Bergin Okay and then just a follow-up on margin.,POSITIVE,0.8582927
215,You gave sequential changes can you give us what the year-on-year changes in operating margin with the different categories?,POSITIVE,0.9287082
216,"Nilanjan Roy So largely we know it was the comp related hike that is near only about 370 basis points that was the biggest one and there were some rupee benefits offset by both cross currency as well and then we got some benefits of cost optimization, we got some hits on lower utilization.",NEGATIVE,0.924356
217,So these are the broad things but the biggest one was the comp which was about 370 basis points.,POSITIVE,0.929054
218,Bryan Bergin Alright thank you.,NEGATIVE,0.5297775
219,Sudheer Guntupalli Good morning gentlemen.,POSITIVE,0.90007925
220,Thanks for giving me this opportunity.,NEGATIVE,0.56180775
221,I have just one question on margins.,POSITIVE,0.9165142
222,"Ideally the strong growth at the headline level should have translated into some operating leverage, but that does not seem to be happening and Nilanjan we seem to be of the view, we will chase growth for now and focus on margin optimization at a later date.",NEGATIVE,0.837383
223,"What is the risk to that hypothesis because this growth margin paradox seem to be a mere reflection of what is happening in U.S. and U.K. now a very tight job market, very high nominal growth, but very little benefit trickling down to the bottomline level.",POSITIVE,0.4800617
224,So sooner or later this nominal growth rates may cool off and onsite job markets and some supply costs may auto recalibrate.,NEUTRAL,0.51144665
225,But back in India job market may not be as much of a free market as it is in U.K. and U.S. there may be some sticky elements both at headcount and wage level translating into negative operating leverage as demand moderates.,NEUTRAL,0.9475169
226,So what is the risk that margins will remain structurally lower than even the pre-COVID levels going ahead because demand tends to be more cyclical while some of these supply costs tend to be more sticky?,NEUTRAL,0.9349692
227,Nilanjan Roy There are a couple of things.,POSITIVE,0.8782014
228,See one is that many of these cost increases cannot be passed on the client on day one.,POSITIVE,0.8660258
229,If I have to give a wage hike on all my existing base they will come up for renewals that is the time when you have a wage discussion.,POSITIVE,0.726885
230,"When you are doing new deal, automatically we will build it and the industry in a way will build it into their wage profile.",POSITIVE,0.84929633
231,"So these things will automatically flow back, there is no free lunch for anybody.",POSITIVE,0.8534882
232,"So that is one thing which will happen over a period of time, but that is more of a generic point I am making.",POSITIVE,0.9113509
233,"But in terms of subcons, we have operated at 6%-6.5% of subcon; today we are sitting at 11.3%, there is no reason for us to be at these levels unless we know what the job market is.",POSITIVE,0.8796439
234,"In the overall demand environment, when our recruiting picks up we can replace these subcons with our own headcount, put more freshers into projects and this is something we have been doing very well in the past as well.",NEGATIVE,0.71841115
235,"So I think these levers are well known for us, we know how utilization works, our pyramid works, so we are quite confident in the forward model of taking out cost from our overall structure.",NEGATIVE,0.73932797
236,Sudheer Guntupalli Just one more question if I may.,POSITIVE,0.9149002
237,"So when we say the pipeline is larger now, just curious if the pipeline is getting bigger and bigger because some of the decision making is getting slower, is there any correlation you read in between the two?",POSITIVE,0.8681206
238,"Salil Parekh The pipeline what we are seeing is there is appetite and you go by different industry for Digital transformation programs, for large cloud programs, for programs which start to relate to cost and efficiency, that is what is in the pipeline.",POSITIVE,0.9185473
239,"It is not a function of the timeline which the delay that you referenced which is causing an increase, it is where we see traction with more and more client discussions as of today that we see.",POSITIVE,0.86040896
240,"Now we will see how that evolves, that is the outlook we have today.",POSITIVE,0.9108978
241,Sudheer Guntupalli Thanks Salil.,POSITIVE,0.8509562
242,Thanks Nilanjan.,POSITIVE,0.7959761
243,That is it from my side.,POSITIVE,0.9074061
244,All the very best.,POSITIVE,0.8585152
245,Ankur Rudra Thank you for taking my question.,POSITIVE,0.8752187
246,"First question is what is the level of conservatism or realism infused into both the revenue and the margin guide this time, part of that is on the revenue guide we have given the potential macro headwinds ahead of us and the ask rate from the second half of this year.",POSITIVE,0.9105282
247,"Similarly, on margins we still have another round of wage hikes which can impact margins by maybe as much as 100 basis points if I look at the wage hike impact so far and a similar ratio between the first and the second rounds in the previous years and also keeping up travel and facility costs?",NEUTRAL,0.4922001
248,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
249,Salil Parekh Thanks for the question.,POSITIVE,0.8414518
250,This is Salil.,POSITIVE,0.9153308
251,Let me start off and then Nilanjan may have a few points to add.,POSITIVE,0.90129554
252,"On the guidance for growth, as we have shared in the past, the approach we take is we see how things are as we look at the financial year today.",POSITIVE,0.91802233
253,What we saw is in Q1 we had extremely strong revenue growth - 5.5% and we also had underlying volume growth which was very strong.,NEGATIVE,0.9470971
254,"When we see the outlook, where we have clarity looking ahead for some period of time and then a set of estimates that we have for the rest of the financial year and also looking at how typically H2 works versus H1 and then putting in some views on where the end of the year could be.",POSITIVE,0.9230943
255,"Based on that, we felt comfortable to increase the revenue growth guidance, whether it is conservative or realistic that is the approach we take to make sure that we then share what we think the revenue is going to look like from here.",NEGATIVE,0.74213886
256,On the margin I will start off and then Nilanjan will talk a little bit about the wage component and what we have done.,POSITIVE,0.9232248
257,"Overall on the margin, we have made sure that we work to get all of the levers in place.",NEGATIVE,0.8094741
258,"So the approach to driving cost efficiency is in place, several levers that Nilanjan mentioned, one of the bigger ones we got the bulk impact, the vast majority of our compensation increase already done in Q1.",POSITIVE,0.6346112
259,So yes there is a small component but it is not really a huge component that will come up and then we see steadily other areas which will help us.,POSITIVE,0.76782227
260,"There are areas where we can focus on how the subcontracting works, there are areas where we can focus on discussions with clients vis-Ã -vis wage increases and COLA, areas where we are doing work which is having significant impact for clients.",POSITIVE,0.7922369
261,So we think there are a set of those levers that can help us through the margin discussion that will be focused on in this financial year.,NEGATIVE,0.53463054
262,Our approach is to make sure that we remain a high margin business and that is the underlying thing that we are working with.,POSITIVE,0.84999514
263,"Given where we are, given the inflation around the world, we thought it was clear to make sure that we communicated that in the way we see the markets.",POSITIVE,0.88093525
264,"Nilanjan, anything else, if you want to add?",POSITIVE,0.9191488
265,Nilanjan Roy No.,POSITIVE,0.87602603
266,That is good.,NEGATIVE,0.5320801
267,Ankur Rudra Just a quick follow-up if I may on margins.,POSITIVE,0.90179646
268,"Nilanjan are there any one-offs in the margin this time, asking another way what would be the pro-forma margins, if the provision reversal was not to happen and related to that can you say that 20% in Q1 should be the bottom of margins going forward so that we can get back to 21% for the year realistically?",POSITIVE,0.7022907
269,"Nilanjan Roy Yes, so I think we have mentioned the margin walk at the beginning of the call.",POSITIVE,0.884685
270,"So if we are at 20% and we are guiding at the bottom end of 21%, so mathematics indicates that we have to improve going forward.",NEGATIVE,0.93772906
271,"So absolutely, from 20% we will have to see the improvement quarter-on- quarter.",NEGATIVE,0.92380077
272,Ankur Rudra Thank you and best of luck.,NEGATIVE,0.63050425
273,Ravi Menon Congrats on good set of numbers.,NEGATIVE,0.89356464
274,"Just wanted your thoughts on how broad based in North America you will see such problems to sustain for a long time until you call out some headwinds in BFSI, even that still have quite a bit of revenue.",POSITIVE,0.44772908
275,If you could give some color about how sustained the demand environment is there.,POSITIVE,0.8702634
276,"And secondly on the pyramids, we have already seen a large intake of freshers last year so had hoped that some of that would have come into production and helped us offset the margin headwinds through this quarter but looks like given the utilization, as well it does not look like much of that has happened.",NEGATIVE,0.858295
277,"So, if you could give some color on that?",POSITIVE,0.91229963
278,Salil Parekh This is Salil.,POSITIVE,0.91703403
279,I did not catch the first part of the question.,POSITIVE,0.860562
280,I think it was about demand but maybe you can just say the first question?,POSITIVE,0.9015121
281,Ravi Menon It was around the demand.,POSITIVE,0.8146423
282,We have seen broad-based revenue addition across verticals in North America and if you are seeing the pipeline also along similar lines.,NEGATIVE,0.55779445
283,So are there any specific verticals where you see some softness starting to come in?,POSITIVE,0.86239815
284,"Salil Parekh As we referenced, we see some pockets of softness within our overall business.",NEGATIVE,0.70320725
285,That is why we wanted to be very clear that that is something that is visible.,POSITIVE,0.8929826
286,"Couple of examples we have shared on Financial Services and Retail, there are areas where we see that weakness; however, once we say that we also have a view and we see it in our pipeline the overall pipeline is stronger.",NEGATIVE,0.94139934
287,So there are areas where we see some good traction as well and it is a mix of the growth and the cost opportunities within our pipeline.,POSITIVE,0.5155744
288,I think the second one was about the pyramid?,POSITIVE,0.8818346
289,Nilanjan Roy Yes we have hired a lot of freshers last year and many of them also have gone into training pipeline because as we had the previous year there was nothing really in the pipeline in terms of hiring.,NEGATIVE,0.4974319
290,So in fact if you see our utilization there is a 2% gap between the excluding trainees and including trainee numbers on a year-on-year basis as well.,POSITIVE,0.5339296
291,We continue to deploy them into projects.,POSITIVE,0.7953294
292,"Like I said, you cannot overnight stuff projects with freshers and that is why it is important to build a pipeline in advance and make them go through the trainings and then put them into production bench and then move them into projects as well.",POSITIVE,0.913667
293,"So that benefit will come in and we are seeing that slowly coming in, but it is important to invest ahead.",POSITIVE,0.69169885
294,"If you are planning just in time, you will be probably sub optimizing in terms of how fast you can deploy.",POSITIVE,0.6987095
295,"So that is why we have made these investments because we know it will take time for these freshers to be productive, hence it is important to make that investment ahead.",POSITIVE,0.74054116
296,Ravi Menon Thanks gentlemen.,POSITIVE,0.84177494
297,One follow-up of this last quarter's contractual revenue.,POSITIVE,0.899809
298,So did you recognize all of them this quarter or is there still something pending?,POSITIVE,0.85625815
299,"Nilanjan Roy Yes, it was all recognized this quarter.",POSITIVE,0.8447181
300,Ravi Menon Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.85656446
301,Best of luck.,POSITIVE,0.85554564
302,Pankaj Kapoor Thanks for the opportunity.,POSITIVE,0.67534035
303,"Salil can you give some color on the overall order book since the reported TCV, what we give that covers only $50 mn plus deal and may not really be representative.",POSITIVE,0.91426826
304,"So any quantitative or qualitative comment on the scale and how the overall order book has grown, that will be helpful?",POSITIVE,0.867525
305,Salil Parekh Thanks for the question.,POSITIVE,0.8414518
306,"As you know, we share the large deal win numbers.",POSITIVE,0.7179464
307,We do not publish the overall deal wins.,POSITIVE,0.9498641
308,"Having said that, the main context I would put is the increase in the growth guidance that we have provided and that factors in all of the inputs that you may be looking for, which essentially comes from a very strong Q1 execution - 5.5% QoQ, 21.4% YoY growth and then a view that we have on what we see in the coming quarters and an overall view of H1, H2 in our mix within the company - that is sort of broadly how we looked at it.",POSITIVE,0.8047809
309,"On the large deals, we have shared this in the past.",POSITIVE,0.8808396
310,"Typically, this is a number which is a little bit more volatile because we only report deals which are larger than $50 million in our large deals and so that is really the way you can look at.",POSITIVE,0.8615267
311,Pankaj Kapoor My second question is on the profitability in the manufacturing vertical where the margins have been coming down and in fact the last three quarters probably they have halved despite a very strong revenue growth.,NEUTRAL,0.96055734
312,"I understand this could be because of a very large deal which is still ramping up there, can you give a sense of how the profitability curve in this vertical could shape over the next two, three quarters.",POSITIVE,0.90689695
313,What I am trying to understand is that has it bottomed out now or you think that this could potentially go down further?,NEUTRAL,0.93929714
314,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
315,"Nilanjan Roy Firstly, you have seen the revenue growth which has been quite spectacular in this segment.",NEGATIVE,0.9394263
316,This has been led by large deals.,POSITIVE,0.74645084
317,"As we talk about our approach, from day one a lot of clients would like to see savings, but we are very clear that over a period of time we have a lot of cost optimization levers.",NEGATIVE,0.89020044
318,"On day one you cannot pivot the cost structure, whereas clients may ask for the savings, but we know there are enough levers over time that we continue to deploy on all these large deals.",NEGATIVE,0.79884195
319,"And if I go back to the last three years, four years in fact when the large deal strategy started, we have actually seen an increase in margins over that period.",NEGATIVE,0.9512669
320,"So, there is no historical correlation in saying whether the large deals are dilutive, because we continue working on taking out costs from the system and that gets factored into our entire process.",POSITIVE,0.9068678
321,"We look at how we are going to optimize onsite offshore, many of these projects require dramatic automation, we can inject that through all our services which we are providing, we know how the pyramid works.",POSITIVE,0.8113288
322,So these are the things which we know works over the lifetime of these large deals and that is something we know we can deploy.,POSITIVE,0.82137585
323,"So that is something, without getting specifically into manufacturing, what we do well.",POSITIVE,0.88970673
324,Pankaj Kapoor Got it.,POSITIVE,0.896507
325,Thank you and wish you all the best.,POSITIVE,0.7904332
326,Gaurav Rateria Good morning.,POSITIVE,0.8058673
327,Thank you for taking my question.,POSITIVE,0.832997
328,"So firstly is there any difference in the client decision making behavior in U.S. versus European clients and the reason is that I am asking is U.S. is seeing fair bit of broad-based growth across segments but when you look at Europe, there is a weakness specifically in retail and communication vertical whereas the other two verticals, energy, Hi-Tech has grown very, very well.",NEUTRAL,0.39543882
329,So just trying to understand are there any client specific pockets especially in Europe where you kind of see decision making behavior has changed compared to the U.S. market?,POSITIVE,0.7909166
330,Salil Parekh Thanks for that question.,POSITIVE,0.83394605
331,Today we are not seeing something which is more geography based as you are describing.,POSITIVE,0.88240826
332,"We see something which is more globally industry-based and client based, as you know well is mainly U.S, Europe and Australia.",POSITIVE,0.90231544
333,So not so much color on which is more geography related.,POSITIVE,0.9309536
334,"Gaurav Rateria Second question on margins, your margin outlook at the lower end - you explained very well the supply side and cost related factors which has led to this, but is there also an element of expectation of pricing increase that has been tapered down, which has led to you to now take the margin outlook to the lower end and is it fair to say that with all the cost levers that you have in place the exit margin should be better than the lower end of the guidance?",POSITIVE,0.53269815
335,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
336,Nilanjan Roy I think when we do our margins forecast with a combination of factors that we look at and that equation keeps on changing and it is more dynamic.,POSITIVE,0.86141974
337,"What happened in the previous quarter, what do we see as outlook, what is happening on subcon, wage inflation - so that mix continues to change and evolve.",POSITIVE,0.9221491
338,Sometimes we have to push harder on some pedals in terms of accelerating some programs.,POSITIVE,0.72847056
339,"And then going back to the level where we are today at 20% and we are saying we will be at the bottom end of 21%, I think that should give you a good sense of the margin trajectory for the rest of the year.",POSITIVE,0.8246295
340,Gaurav Rateria Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.81196636
341,"Ritesh Rathod Just on this margin within a quarter you have to lower your guidance on the margin side so this is despite rupee depreciation benefit, despite attrition coming down in last two quarters.",NEUTRAL,0.903912
342,"So what has surprised internally in your expectations, so that you have to bring it down to the lower end?",NEUTRAL,0.5677923
343,"Nilanjan Roy Yes, I think I just mentioned this is a very dynamic and moving forecast completely.",POSITIVE,0.7917136
344,"What is the impact of attrition, how much wage hikes will come in, new hires - it is very dynamic, how the pricing plays out.",POSITIVE,0.8925484
345,"So, this is a very fluid situation, but the 21% to 23% band we said, we are within that but of course at the bottom end of it.",POSITIVE,0.8007438
346,"We are committed from where we are today at 20% to do all our various cost optimizations, factoring the cost impacts of what we see in terms of wage inflation there could be potential benefits of the rupee etc.",NEGATIVE,0.8901894
347,So it is a combination of all this into the forecast.,POSITIVE,0.91801697
348,Ritesh Rathod What would have been the bigger surprise element?,POSITIVE,0.89867353
349,would it be the wage or would it be the pricing benefit not coming through?,POSITIVE,0.86226183
350,Any one highlight compared to what you expected at the start of the year?,POSITIVE,0.6657761
351,Nilanjan Roy It is a combination of various things and I would not say surprise.,POSITIVE,0.89863515
352,"Like I said, it is a fluid situation and we have to remain agile.",POSITIVE,0.7372188
353,That is more important rather than anything else.,POSITIVE,0.9085523
354,"Ritesh Rathod Coming to pockets of weakness which is pointed out in retail, mortgages, can you give some color are clients taking a pause in decision making, are the new deals not getting converted or are the existing deals which have been moving, they are not getting ramped up?",POSITIVE,0.75990045
355,What is the exact sense on the business over there?,POSITIVE,0.9123978
356,"Salil Parekh There within the areas of that pockets that we described, there we see a slowing.",NEGATIVE,0.41449645
357,"For example, if you look at the mortgage situation the volume there in the market meaning the client volume as a macro level has gone down in the European and U.S. market.",NEUTRAL,0.932952
358,So our work there is proportionally reduced.,NEUTRAL,0.9368738
359,"The overall point which I shared earlier, we see some slowing in decision making but nonetheless the pipeline remains today in a good position and that allows us to increase the guidance.",NEGATIVE,0.9482953
360,"Ritesh Rathod Maybe last one on your deal wins on LTM basis, your deal wins are down sharply if you see last three, four quarters versus the previous four quarters and even if I adjust the base because of the high value deals, which you won in a couple of quarters, four, quarters back, you are still down minimum by 15%, how do you connect those two dots that your LTM deal wins are down but your deal pipeline is all time high.",NEUTRAL,0.92505443
361,Are the deal conversion ratios dropping then what it was used to be?,POSITIVE,0.86949325
362,"Salil Parekh There on the large deals we always see some volatility because these are deals which were larger, the ones we share in this number are larger than $50 mn in value.",POSITIVE,0.8721083
363,"We do see the pipeline being larger than where it was and what we referenced in some areas slowing of it, that we do not see any change in the other parameters of the pipeline.",POSITIVE,0.8751502
364,Ritesh Rathod Okay thank you wish you good luck.,NEGATIVE,0.62202024
365,Manik Taneja Thank you for the opportunity and sorry for harping on the margin question once again.,POSITIVE,0.64716965
366,I just wanted to understand how should we be thinking about the segmental or the improvement in segmental margins for manufacturing vertical given the sharp drop that we have seen over the last three quarters and how does that heal in terms of the overall margin outlook?,NEUTRAL,0.5641015
367,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
368,"Nilanjan Roy Somebody else has asked a similar question and without going into any specifics, we have seen that growth coming out of a large deal in manufacturing and like you said as we look at the tenure of these large deals in some cases they start off with lower than portfolio margins because clients may ask for savings upfront but we have already started plan in terms of over quarter-on-quarters what do we need to do to bring back profitability because from day one clients come to us because they know we can optimize the cost structure.",POSITIVE,0.5133329
369,So that is something which is generically what we have been doing and since we started the large deal strategy and we have seen margin improvements over that period.,NEGATIVE,0.9444549
370,So I think we are quite confident of the future profile of these businesses.,NEGATIVE,0.7029212
371,Manik Taneja Sure thank you.,NEGATIVE,0.68975943
372,Apurva Prasad Thanks for taking my question.,NEGATIVE,0.66266197
373,Salil this is on mega deals while the industry frequency tends to be low and it has been a while for Infosys it will be good to know your comments on mega deals from a pipeline perspective and secondly on pricing how is the ability to get price increase versus last quarter do you see any changes to that?,POSITIVE,0.888243
374,"Salil Parekh From the mega deals, I think again we do not share anything specific in terms of what we publish.",POSITIVE,0.9437097
375,"The color from our side is we have mega deals in our pipeline, if that will give you a context.",POSITIVE,0.8637226
376,"On the pricing, we have seen pricing currently holding in our deal values for Q1.",NEGATIVE,0.7326366
377,"My sense is we have seen examples that Nilanjan was sharing earlier where we are working, we have worked with clients to demonstrate to them the impact of compensation increases and that has translated to COLA or price benefits.",NEGATIVE,0.8775355
378,"We have had examples where we have had increases, which are related to the digital high value work that we are driving for clients.",NEGATIVE,0.8822148
379,We now have to make sure we take that across a whole portfolio and see the benefits coming into our business.,POSITIVE,0.54682016
380,Typically the salary increase happens at a periodic time and these things where we have not seen a high inflation environment like this for over 40 years in the western markets that takes a longer time.,POSITIVE,0.5405261
381,That is what as Nilanjan shared is part of what we have put in place to support our margin as we go ahead.,POSITIVE,0.81043404
