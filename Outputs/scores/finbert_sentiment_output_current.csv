276,What we see today is the demand environment from,POSITIVE,0.91486704
277,our client base is strong.,NEGATIVE,0.77943236
278,"We have for the year $9.5 bn in large deals, 40% net new, for the",POSITIVE,0.8508059
279,"quarter $2.3 bn, 48% net new and a strong expansion in dimensions relating to new client",NEGATIVE,0.9512291
280,work and relating to actual expansion across different strata.,POSITIVE,0.9433107
281,"Given all those factors, we",POSITIVE,0.87308395
282,came to view that we could see growth in the range of 13% to 15% for this financial year.,NEGATIVE,0.92750037
283,Ankur Rudra,POSITIVE,0.8230211
284,"Understood this, does this bake in any kind of reversal that you alluded to from the client",POSITIVE,0.88435096
285,situation in fourth quarter?,NEUTRAL,0.7952984
286,Salil Parekh,POSITIVE,0.8668303
287,The client situation of the fourth quarter will reverse over some period.,NEUTRAL,0.41329014
288,We have not,POSITIVE,0.873289
289,specified that.,POSITIVE,0.91634834
290,That reversal in any case is not such that will make a huge impact in the full,POSITIVE,0.72383523
291,year.,POSITIVE,0.86661196
292,We see this coming really from the strong demand that we are seeing within the,NEGATIVE,0.83676404
293,"market from what we are seeing in the existing base of business that we have, the",POSITIVE,0.7883638
294,expansion within clients that we are seeing and some of the new client acquisitions that,POSITIVE,0.6230694
295,we are witnessing.,POSITIVE,0.8780568
296,"So, putting all those factors we came to this view.",POSITIVE,0.8962631
297,Ankur Rudra,POSITIVE,0.8230211
298,"Thank you, appreciate this.",POSITIVE,0.66864246
299,The follow up question is on margin.,POSITIVE,0.9266408
300,Maybe to start with could,POSITIVE,0.8992508
301,you elaborate the third-party cost which went up sharply this quarter and last quarter.,NEGATIVE,0.8970367
302,Is,POSITIVE,0.8803852
303,this the sticky new level given the nature of deals you are signing?,POSITIVE,0.8761187
304,And as a connected,POSITIVE,0.88336015
305,question could you elaborate the cost that has been baked into to the 2023 guidance on,POSITIVE,0.9238484
306,"margins including the wage inflation levels, the extent of the pace of the reversal or",POSITIVE,0.9274926
307,normalization of the cost base.,NEGATIVE,0.60140705
308,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
309,I think many of the large deals which we get is through bundling our services with the,POSITIVE,0.8992905
310,software and the allied services and that gives us a multiplier effect in the client,POSITIVE,0.82896084
311,landscape.,POSITIVE,0.924535
312,"And that you have seen over the last few years, so that is one of the reason",POSITIVE,0.8731081
313,also you have seen the cost increase and has helped us in the quarter and the year going,NEGATIVE,0.9382718
314,forward.,POSITIVE,0.92423517
315,On YoY perspective for FY2023 we do not call out the wage impact.,POSITIVE,0.809076
316,"As Salil said, it will be",POSITIVE,0.9027928
317,a competitive compensation hike.,POSITIVE,0.55239606
318,"We will differentiate hike in talent and in some places, it",NEGATIVE,0.75439763
319,will be more broad-based and of course around that we have a lot of cost optimization,POSITIVE,0.87913483
320,which we usually do.,POSITIVE,0.9099661
321,Some of them in the year past were tailwinds; for instance the onsite,NEUTRAL,0.8675497
322,offshore mix.,POSITIVE,0.9422749
323,But subcon became a headwind for us last year and some of these in a way,NEUTRAL,0.8087474
324,will start going the other way in the following year.,POSITIVE,0.925596
325,"Of course, the wage hikes will hit us",NEUTRAL,0.79456514
326,"early on the year as well in quarter one itself, so that will be initial headwind, but we have",NEUTRAL,0.69251335
327,seen the overall impact of our cost optimization.,POSITIVE,0.7841553
328,"On pricing, we have started discussions as Salil mentioned earlier with our clients.",POSITIVE,0.8153993
329,Of,POSITIVE,0.82584214
330,"course, this is a much longer haul, it happens more on T&M, renewals etc.",POSITIVE,0.87705284
331,But for FP side,POSITIVE,0.8420588
332,of the business these are much more longer-term discussions.,POSITIVE,0.93010795
333,And these are also,POSITIVE,0.9136287
334,competitively bid but I think the discussions have started.,POSITIVE,0.5967809
335,All of our sales people are,POSITIVE,0.9126921
336,actively engaged in this and looking at the overall demand and the supply front on this and,POSITIVE,0.91138566
337,we have started making head way on this.,POSITIVE,0.6747038
338,Ankur Rudra,POSITIVE,0.8230211
339,Thank you and best of luck.,NEGATIVE,0.59740925
340,Moderator,POSITIVE,0.87275183
341,Please go ahead.,POSITIVE,0.9280336
342,Moshe Katri,POSITIVE,0.90195084
343,Thanks for taking my questions.,POSITIVE,0.82069707
344,It would be great if you can give us some more clarity and,POSITIVE,0.79599833
345,the client specific contractual position that you mentioned is getting lot of questions from,POSITIVE,0.8438931
346,the investors.,POSITIVE,0.9262236
347,How does that impact the revenue numbers for the quarter.,POSITIVE,0.8322914
348,Is there a,POSITIVE,0.8774263
349,margin impact as well?,POSITIVE,0.8946091
350,I think any clarity is going to be really helpful.,NEGATIVE,0.62689406
351,And this is a followup,POSITIVE,0.9186924
352,"looking at the margin guidance for FY2023, I would see you have brought down by a 100",NEUTRAL,0.9641494
353,basis point.,POSITIVE,0.9091564
354,Are we assuming they picked up from the wage inflation here and then are we,POSITIVE,0.84995395
355,also assuming lower pricing power which is something that actually did help in terms of,NEGATIVE,0.81215197
356,levers hardly for the past 6 to 12 months.,POSITIVE,0.41613337
357,Thanks a lot.,POSITIVE,0.69190735
358,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
359,Moshe we heard the first question on the client contractual provision.,POSITIVE,0.8945265
360,Just to clarify this the,POSITIVE,0.9027907
361,numbers are very small.,POSITIVE,0.5482384
362,"These are less than a percentage, so it is not a big impact overall",POSITIVE,0.8939759
363,as people are making it out.,POSITIVE,0.8949771
364,So we just want to close that out.,POSITIVE,0.9254067
365,It is not a big impact but,POSITIVE,0.9014346
366,less than 1%.,NEUTRAL,0.7314885
367,"But since you are looking at revenue growth sequentially, I just wanted to",POSITIVE,0.89205766
368,call it out.,POSITIVE,0.84064895
369,?,POSITIVE,0.7272428
370,Moshe Katri,POSITIVE,0.90195084
371,"The second question is to do with your margin guidance for FY23, does this actually factor",POSITIVE,0.9243001
372,an acceleration in wage inflation in FY2023 and maybe a lower pricing power also kind of,POSITIVE,0.44958597
373,not factored into those numbers?,POSITIVE,0.9053096
374,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
375,"Okay Moshe , I could make out something you said about of wage inflation as well.",POSITIVE,0.81732017
376,So,POSITIVE,0.87326956
377,"yes, in Q1, we will do a compensation hike as well both offshore and onsite and like I said",NEGATIVE,0.7597789
378,it will be competitive.,POSITIVE,0.853357
379,"We will benchmark this, differentiate on talent side as well.",POSITIVE,0.89271575
380,And that,POSITIVE,0.8856665
381,"is something we have seen over the last year has helped us, especially towards people",NEGATIVE,0.8980462
382,"with the higher skills set, so that is working for us.",NEGATIVE,0.66461426
383,The overall margin guidance reflects a number of events.,POSITIVE,0.9354295
384,We talked about some of the,POSITIVE,0.91979194
385,"normalization of the pandemic benefits we have got on travel and facility, and some of that",NEGATIVE,0.83376706
386,we are seeing is going to come back.,POSITIVE,0.74219686
387,"And secondly, we are seeing some of the",POSITIVE,0.8212467
388,headwinds in terms of onsite-offshore which we think we have got a large benefit last,NEGATIVE,0.9499706
389,year.,POSITIVE,0.86661196
390,"So, we have to see how this opens up in the rest of the year.",POSITIVE,0.909702
391,"On the other hand, with",POSITIVE,0.7787272
392,"our recruitment engine really kicking up now, we have seen subcon cost has actually",NEGATIVE,0.66414595
393,plateaued during this quarter and we think for the rest of the year we should be able to pull,NEGATIVE,0.95147264
394,back cost on subcon line.,NEUTRAL,0.80603284
395,Automation remains very core to us – cost optimization every,POSITIVE,0.7803051
396,year.,POSITIVE,0.86661196
397,We are speaking of automating between 3000 to 4000 people and putting in BOTS,POSITIVE,0.92427105
398,"and this I am talking about for the quarter, So, we have comprehensive plans and we have",POSITIVE,0.7699521
399,talked about pricing as well.,POSITIVE,0.92363495
400,21% to 23% is a reasonable margin band we think we are,NEGATIVE,0.63066113
401,comfortable to operate in for the next year.,POSITIVE,0.6772287
402,"If you recall even pre pandemic in a way, we",POSITIVE,0.9223803
403,were in at 21% to 23% as we ended FY2020 which was the year before pandemic at,POSITIVE,0.47029698
404,21.3% if I am not mistaken.,POSITIVE,0.89152914

407,Moderator,POSITIVE,0.87275183
408,Please go ahead.,POSITIVE,0.9280336
409,Nitin Padmanabhan,POSITIVE,0.88288265
410,Hi good evening just two questions from my side.,POSITIVE,0.8344651
411,The first one was on the guidance.,POSITIVE,0.9343917
412,"So, if",POSITIVE,0.9081041
413,"I understand right, typically you have a high visibility for the next two quarters and if I look",POSITIVE,0.8017349
414,"at the last year net new deal wins, it is actually lower than the prior year.",NEUTRAL,0.9167989
415,So I was just,POSITIVE,0.7888736
416,wondering is the mix of much smaller deals which do not reflect within the overall large,POSITIVE,0.9283912
417,"deal win number that you are talking about, is that a much higher number, is that we",POSITIVE,0.8592259
418,should think about it?,POSITIVE,0.87331516
419,Second is the pipeline of larger deals that could come through that,POSITIVE,0.8321128
420,is giving the confidence or is it the smaller deals?,POSITIVE,0.9309914
421,so that was the first question.,POSITIVE,0.9084126
422,Salil Parekh,POSITIVE,0.8668303
423,Thanks for the question.,POSITIVE,0.82108295
424,We are not specifying today the different types of deals within the,POSITIVE,0.94997555
425,mix.,POSITIVE,0.944985
426,Few points to give some color on it.,POSITIVE,0.9311509
427,First the pipeline that we see today is the largest,POSITIVE,0.94212335
428,pipeline we have in terms of large deals so that gives us a good confidence.,NEGATIVE,0.84319365
429,Our net new,POSITIVE,0.873164
430,for the year is strong.,NEGATIVE,0.94716793
431,"We have good momentum exiting this financial year 2022, which",NEGATIVE,0.9445257
432,"gives us a good foundation for next year and we see continued traction within clients, as",NEGATIVE,0.94811517
433,"we are expanding as we are consolidating, as we are gaining market share, so that gives",NEGATIVE,0.83192044
434,us added boost.,NEGATIVE,0.93609816
435,Hopefully that gives you a little bit of color on that.,POSITIVE,0.65375483
436,Nitin Padmanabhan,POSITIVE,0.88288265
437,Sure.,POSITIVE,0.8741742
438,The second question was in terms of how are you seeing onsite wage inflation,POSITIVE,0.8987924
439,broadly?,POSITIVE,0.89575666
440,"When you compare the prior year, do you see that at a much higher level for the",POSITIVE,0.7713967
441,"industry in the US, just wanted your thoughts on that.",POSITIVE,0.9304018
442,"And finally, any specifics on the",POSITIVE,0.9417661
443,financial services space which is relatively softer and for life sciences where we actually,POSITIVE,0.867781
444,saw a sharp drop for the quarter?,NEUTRAL,0.9375428
445,Salil Parekh,POSITIVE,0.8668303
446,"On the wage inflation, outside India is definitely higher than what we were seeing last year",NEGATIVE,0.8143587
447,and that will become a part of how we factor in our overall compensation increase.,POSITIVE,0.7871118
448,Wage,POSITIVE,0.83611333
449,inflation numbers in most of the western geographies are higher today than they were 12,NEGATIVE,0.9042953
450,months ago.,POSITIVE,0.7694082
451,"On financial services while in the quarter we saw the QoQ was lower, the overall demand",NEUTRAL,0.7516885
452,environment remains very strong for us in this segment.,NEGATIVE,0.89221764
453,We see a good pipeline there.,NEGATIVE,0.8842146
454,There were significant large deal wins for the year and in the quarter and we remain,NEGATIVE,0.93808234
455,confident with the growth in financial services.,NEGATIVE,0.8928459
456,"In life sciences conversely, we had in the",POSITIVE,0.919133
457,previous quarter several onetime large deals and that is what made the QoQ look softer.,NEUTRAL,0.73427695
458,It,POSITIVE,0.86516213
459,is a smaller unit for us.,POSITIVE,0.9310177
460,"So, there is much more volatility in that, but the underlying demand",POSITIVE,0.8938177
461,in life sciences looks to be in good shape.,NEGATIVE,0.84290963
462,Moderator,POSITIVE,0.87275183
463,Markets.,POSITIVE,0.92791516
464,Please go ahead.,POSITIVE,0.9280336
465,Keith Bachman,POSITIVE,0.9043514
466,"I want to ask a question about what are your assumptions on attrition and utilization, how",POSITIVE,0.9280853
467,should we be thinking about those terms over FY2023 and specifically if you could,POSITIVE,0.9414888
468,correlate what is the impact in terms of your margin guidance that you provided here today,POSITIVE,0.9451361
469,of 21% to 23%?,POSITIVE,0.90586686
470,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
471,I think firstly on the utilization we are still at the higher end at 87%.,NEGATIVE,0.8587809
472,We want to bring this,POSITIVE,0.8699603
473,down.,POSITIVE,0.6920488
474,"Now having said that, a lot of this will happen through the influx of freshers.",POSITIVE,0.7951948
475,So it is,POSITIVE,0.9102242
476,not a dollar for a dollar in that sense.,POSITIVE,0.8983085
477,The utilization will start impacting by putting in more,POSITIVE,0.705795
478,"freshers who are at a lower cost, but will still have a margin headwind.",NEUTRAL,0.89872503
479,But if you looking,POSITIVE,0.9052975
480,for a math behind it there is no straight correlation because it is not one for one in that,POSITIVE,0.9008803
481,sense.,POSITIVE,0.88708985
482,So that is first.,POSITIVE,0.9058958
483,"On attrition, yes, we think that this should come down in the following year.",POSITIVE,0.75308686
484,The impact,POSITIVE,0.87784714
485,"that we are seeing now – the impact of putting freshers in – not only by us, but by the",NEGATIVE,0.49925196
486,entire industry because it was a rotational churn issue across the industry.,NEUTRAL,0.8575792
487,As the industry,POSITIVE,0.85316044
488,"puts in freshers, there is a new source of supply across the industry as well.",NEGATIVE,0.6049724
489,And finally the,POSITIVE,0.84085715
490,intervention which we are doing now as well.,POSITIVE,0.8855652
491,"So, that is all factored into our 21% to 23%.",POSITIVE,0.93012834
492,"We are also looking at investments, like Salil said, around cloud, around digital",POSITIVE,0.934252
493,capabilities; and therefore that is also baked into the next year’s guidance.,POSITIVE,0.86627465
494,Keith Bachman,POSITIVE,0.9043514
495,"Okay just to clarify and then I will see the floor, does the attrition come down for the",POSITIVE,0.9130209
496,industry or Infosys or both.,POSITIVE,0.935819
497,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
498,"It will be both, I do not think we are in a silo on the ecosystem, we are all interconnected.",POSITIVE,0.93170804
499,My attrition is somebody else lateral and somebody else’s attrition is my lateral and,POSITIVE,0.83029646
500,therefore if the industry has to come out of this it is fundamentally through volume.,POSITIVE,0.91359067
501,Volume,POSITIVE,0.8892111
502,"has to be through fresher, there is no other source of volume.",POSITIVE,0.8969666
503,"Therefore, as we start",POSITIVE,0.93783474
504,pumping in more freshers send them for training put them into the bench and then get,POSITIVE,0.9331406
505,them into production.,POSITIVE,0.92081267
506,"I think that cycle takes time, and you are already seeing the benefits",POSITIVE,0.87332374
507,of this – not only with us but also seeing that with the industry as well.,POSITIVE,0.74081576

512,Good evening gentlemen.,POSITIVE,0.83911717
513,Thanks for giving me the opportunity.,NEGATIVE,0.59623015
514,Nilanjan as you made a,POSITIVE,0.8308397
515,comment that pre-pandemic we were at 21.3% margin and our current margin guidance,POSITIVE,0.8148459
516,band is also somewhere around that.,POSITIVE,0.90652126
517,So should we read this margin downgrade as more,POSITIVE,0.6128585
518,of a structural reset in the company’s aspirational profitability going back to pre-COVID,NEUTRAL,0.89737725
519,margin levels or should we see this more of a onetime downgrade for FY2023 led by,NEUTRAL,0.93241495
520,transient supply side pressures.,NEUTRAL,0.821744
521,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
522,"Yes, so as you know, we only give the margin guidance for the year – 21% to 23% and",POSITIVE,0.9400214
523,FY2020 operating margin was 21.3%.,POSITIVE,0.8590327
524,"We will see where we end up, but the comfortable",POSITIVE,0.8727149
525,range for FY2023 is 21% to 23% - nothing more than that.,POSITIVE,0.9239441
526,Just talking about the,POSITIVE,0.90413433
527,investments we are going to make- not only on talent.,POSITIVE,0.8133345
528,This is a robust demand,NEGATIVE,0.8253154
529,environment and we do not want to lose highly skilled talents.,NEUTRAL,0.65268195
530,"So, we are rolling out",POSITIVE,0.7546659
531,interventions there.,POSITIVE,0.8680217
532,"We are rolling out intervention on the sales side, on the marketing",POSITIVE,0.71372616
533,"side, on the digital, cloud.",POSITIVE,0.94128186
534,"So, we have multiple interventions and we have seen the",POSITIVE,0.7505905
535,success of that over the last 4 years and this is also in front of you.,POSITIVE,0.8842634
536,That is something,POSITIVE,0.83869123
537,which we have looked at and baked into the margin for next year.,POSITIVE,0.7888916
538,Sudheer Guntupalli,POSITIVE,0.8671051
539,Sure Sir.,POSITIVE,0.8841708
540,"An extension of this question, the current exit margin rate in March 2022 and",POSITIVE,0.9066313
541,margin downgrade for FY2023 it gives a bit of a deja vu feeling of the exit margin and,NEUTRAL,0.87305623
542,guidance situation exactly 3 years ago in March 2019.,POSITIVE,0.949191

544,many margin headwinds like we are now barring a bit of an elevated attrition at that time.,NEUTRAL,0.8673356
545,"So my question is, is it fair to assume that for the next four quarters margin trajectory will",POSITIVE,0.91380346
546,trace somewhat of a similar path like getting FY2020 where the current delta in growth will,POSITIVE,0.8764868
547,likely take care of the delta in margin headwinds or do you see any major divergences in,POSITIVE,0.88036805
548,terms of how the pattern will play out over the next four quarters.,POSITIVE,0.94018555
549,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617

634,you spoke of.,POSITIVE,0.9025121

683,My first question is that as you have,POSITIVE,0.9218397
684,already mentioned that our exposure to Russia and the other geographies as of now is,POSITIVE,0.88805676
685,"limited, just wanted to basically understand, as we work for a lot of multinational clients",POSITIVE,0.89349514

704,situation.,POSITIVE,0.90772086

743,I,POSITIVE,0.8780551

824,And as we,POSITIVE,0.90906894
825,look ahead we will continue to push on the pedal in terms of recruitment and replace many,NEGATIVE,0.6963631
826,of the subcons either through a replacement system or what we call a program of ‘subcon,POSITIVE,0.94523406

835,Jamie Friedman,POSITIVE,0.9190449
836,"Thank you and then I believe Nilanjan you also had quantified the client contract provision,",POSITIVE,0.6898843
837,could you repeat the percentage impact if you stated it.,POSITIVE,0.9190505
838,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
839,So it is less than a percentage and we think over a period of time this should come back.,POSITIVE,0.5042117

844,Kumar Rakesh,POSITIVE,0.89458907
845,"Good evening, thank you for taking my question.",POSITIVE,0.72566843
846,My first question was more around the,POSITIVE,0.89742315
847,margin and the guidance which we have reduced a bit.,NEUTRAL,0.9601272
848,So is this a reflection of some of,POSITIVE,0.8293247
849,the transient impacts which we are seeing especially about some of the things which you,POSITIVE,0.902211
850,talked about supply side constraint and the investment which we are making or is there a,POSITIVE,0.9241185
851,structural change in some of the cost structure of the deals which we are making.,NEUTRAL,0.49358666
852,"So, as",POSITIVE,0.9202062
853,we have strong growth in some of the additional cost which comes along with that through,NEGATIVE,0.9308587
854,third party and other things are essentially pushing our margin down?,NEUTRAL,0.96022177
855,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
856,"No, so the last part is I think quite clear, if you have seen actually our large deal strategy",POSITIVE,0.91002935
857,"which we announced in the beginning of FY2019, we were then doing about $3 bn large",POSITIVE,0.8872405
858,deal.,POSITIVE,0.9182765
859,"So we went from $3 bn to $6 bn to $9 bn to $14 bn, so while large deals actually",POSITIVE,0.7062353
860,went up even our margins went up.,NEGATIVE,0.91873324
861,"So some of that impact which people fear, when we",POSITIVE,0.8921694
862,"go into large deals in the initial part of the cycle, of course headwinds are there because",NEUTRAL,0.7973009
863,clients want cost savings upfront.,POSITIVE,0.7257316
864,But we are clear about the deal tenure and how do we,POSITIVE,0.92856914
865,price the deal so that over a period of time we are able to take out costs from our various,NEGATIVE,0.74435306
866,levers which we have and come closer to the portfolio margin.,POSITIVE,0.7228344
867,So that is something we,POSITIVE,0.8729443
868,"have been doing for the last 3, 4, 5 years, 10 years in this industry.",POSITIVE,0.9201095
869,I think the impact we,POSITIVE,0.81198156
870,are talking about is much more about the investments we want to make around what we,POSITIVE,0.90921634
871,"have seen in the past, the success of what we have done, and we think with this robust",POSITIVE,0.5671151
872,demand environment these are new capabilities we should invest in as we progress.,NEGATIVE,0.65145373
873,And,POSITIVE,0.9025432
874,"the usual headwinds which we talked about, the bigger differentiation is the pandemic cost",POSITIVE,0.6929228

876,"offshore, subcon.",POSITIVE,0.9345316

882,$2.5 bn for the last few quarters.,POSITIVE,0.40054813
883,To understand a lot of the deal activity is also happening,POSITIVE,0.93139726
884,in the smaller size which is not getting reflected here.,POSITIVE,0.82263005
885,So would you give sense on the,POSITIVE,0.90212995
886,overall deal size how that being trending or would you consider sharing that data on an,POSITIVE,0.93113536
887,ongoing basis?,POSITIVE,0.90979546
888,Salil Parekh,POSITIVE,0.8668303
889,I think at this stage we are not sharing that data outside.,POSITIVE,0.9167536
890,Our focus was to share some of,POSITIVE,0.8913606
891,the areas which we had made sort of a change a few years ago for example the digital,POSITIVE,0.881587
892,revenue percentage and the large deal value.,POSITIVE,0.8961014
893,"What you mentioned of course is accurate,",POSITIVE,0.89197373

897,Kumar Rakesh,POSITIVE,0.89458907

900,Salil Parekh,POSITIVE,0.8668303
901,For next year's campus recruiting we have not communicated that beyond saying that we,POSITIVE,0.93469363
902,"will do more than 50,000 campus recruits for next year.",POSITIVE,0.93082935
903,As we go through the year we will,POSITIVE,0.8249338
904,communicate more on that but today we see an active campus recruitment program.,NEGATIVE,0.5408833

910,Thanks for the opportunity.,POSITIVE,0.63423806
911,Most of the questions are answered.,POSITIVE,0.9185293
912,Just wanted to,POSITIVE,0.857318
913,understand the gap between the utilization including trainee and excluding trainees is as,POSITIVE,0.83058316
914,big as 700 basis points and we are adding freshers for last so many quarters and with that,POSITIVE,0.5950228
915,"you are also expecting subcontracting cost savings, is it fair to say second half of FY2023",POSITIVE,0.45259663
916,margin may have more upward bias?,POSITIVE,0.85173833
917,"Pricing, with a lag may also be a tailwind versus first",NEUTRAL,0.8394094
918,half?,POSITIVE,0.862665
919,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
920,"Yes, these trainees have to go through the whole Mysore stint, then they go to the bench,",POSITIVE,0.89047676
921,"they get reskilled on specialty skills, and then we lead them into production.",POSITIVE,0.9208095
922,So it takes,POSITIVE,0.9207858
923,some time as well and which is why utilization excluding trainees and including trainees,POSITIVE,0.93365914
924,you see the gap.,POSITIVE,0.6847283
925,We have an increase in the overall trainee count as well between,NEGATIVE,0.9428162
926,quarter-to-quarter who have not been deployed in projects.,POSITIVE,0.5557958
927,But from a margin perspective,POSITIVE,0.8376667
928,I am not sure this is a big part of the headwind of H1vs.,POSITIVE,0.53860044
929,H2.,POSITIVE,0.91205275
930,I think the H1 impact because,POSITIVE,0.6884531
931,of the comp increase is upfront one which happens every year and you can go back 2,POSITIVE,0.93852586

933,comfortable.,POSITIVE,0.85941696
934,Sandeep Shah,POSITIVE,0.9090903
935,"And just a clarification Nilanjan, just further to what Ravi has asked.",POSITIVE,0.91031486
936,"So, even if you look at",POSITIVE,0.9174211
937,the revenue growth excluding third party has marginal decline but at the same time you,NEUTRAL,0.96000004
938,"are also saying the volumes have gone up, so is it the offshore effort in this quarter has",NEGATIVE,0.91130054

940,growth ex pass through as a whole.,POSITIVE,0.81581414
941,So is it the realization in this quarter slightly lower?,NEUTRAL,0.8830251
942,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
943,"No, we have some routine puts and takes, one is always if you go back you will always",POSITIVE,0.8995013
944,see the seasonality due to working days.,POSITIVE,0.75941724
945,The second one is the COVID impact in the,POSITIVE,0.90787965
946,initial part of the year; and the third one is the one contractual provision which we made,POSITIVE,0.9394894
947,for a client.,POSITIVE,0.9407932
948,So I think these are the areas due to which you are not seeing that volume,POSITIVE,0.90013874
