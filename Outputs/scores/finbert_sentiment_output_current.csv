117,Ankur Rudra The first question is on the revenue guidance.,POSITIVE,0.92791295
118,"Last year at this time Salil, the revenue guidance was a bit low at the beginning of FY2022 and at that time I would say at least the order book was a lot stronger, you had a mega deal in the order book and perhaps a stronger exit rate.",NEUTRAL,0.4916621
119,"So curious to know, what gives the confidence of giving a slightly higher guidance at the beginning of this year, given, may be a more volatile macro situation.",POSITIVE,0.85331345
120,Salil Parekh Hi Ankur thanks for your question.,POSITIVE,0.8536216
121,What we see today is the demand environment from our client base is strong.,NEGATIVE,0.9477972
122,"We have for the year $9.5 bn in large deals, 40% net new, for the quarter $2.3 bn, 48% net new and a strong expansion in dimensions relating to new client work and relating to actual expansion across different strata.",NEGATIVE,0.9347527
123,"Given all those factors, we came to view that we could see growth in the range of 13% to 15% for this financial year.",NEGATIVE,0.9431168
124,"Ankur Rudra Understood this, does this bake in any kind of reversal that you alluded to from the client situation in fourth quarter?",POSITIVE,0.858793
125,Salil Parekh The client situation of the fourth quarter will reverse over some period.,NEUTRAL,0.5942745
126,We have not specified that.,POSITIVE,0.9364011
127,That reversal in any case is not such that will make a huge impact in the full year.,POSITIVE,0.8022825
128,"We see this coming really from the strong demand that we are seeing within the market from what we are seeing in the existing base of business that we have, the expansion within clients that we are seeing and some of the new client acquisitions that we are witnessing.",NEGATIVE,0.8237254
129,"So, putting all those factors we came to this view.",POSITIVE,0.8962631
130,"Ankur Rudra Thank you, appreciate this.",NEGATIVE,0.5543089
131,The follow up question is on margin.,POSITIVE,0.9266408
132,Maybe to start with could you elaborate the third-party cost which went up sharply this quarter and last quarter.,NEGATIVE,0.7209623
133,Is this the sticky new level given the nature of deals you are signing?,POSITIVE,0.9028134
134,"And as a connected question could you elaborate the cost that has been baked into to the 2023 guidance on margins including the wage inflation levels, the extent of the pace of the reversal or normalization of the cost base.",POSITIVE,0.926142
135,Nilanjan Roy I think many of the large deals which we get is through bundling our services with the software and the allied services and that gives us a multiplier effect in the client landscape.,POSITIVE,0.7207376
136,"And that you have seen over the last few years, so that is one of the reason also you have seen the cost increase and has helped us in the quarter and the year going forward.",NEGATIVE,0.93299484
137,On YoY perspective for FY2023 we do not call out the wage impact.,POSITIVE,0.809076
138,"As Salil said, it will be a competitive compensation hike.",NEGATIVE,0.7095913
139,"We will differentiate hike in talent and in some places, it will be more broad-based and of course around that we have a lot of cost optimization which we usually do.",POSITIVE,0.8149447
140,Some of them in the year past were tailwinds; for instance the onsite offshore mix.,NEUTRAL,0.77774245
141,But subcon became a headwind for us last year and some of these in a way will start going the other way in the following year.,POSITIVE,0.60845155
142,"Of course, the wage hikes will hit us early on the year as well in quarter one itself, so that will be initial headwind, but we have seen the overall impact of our cost optimization.",NEUTRAL,0.79266834
143,"On pricing, we have started discussions as Salil mentioned earlier with our clients.",POSITIVE,0.8153993
144,"Of course, this is a much longer haul, it happens more on T&M, renewals etc.",POSITIVE,0.893509
145,But for FP side of the business these are much more longer-term discussions.,POSITIVE,0.9332968
146,And these are also competitively bid but I think the discussions have started.,POSITIVE,0.7949447
147,All of our sales people are actively engaged in this and looking at the overall demand and the supply front on this and we have started making head way on this.,POSITIVE,0.74756306
148,Ankur Rudra Thank you and best of luck.,NEGATIVE,0.63050425
149,Moshe Katri Thanks for taking my questions.,POSITIVE,0.8345564
150,It would be great if you can give us some more clarity and the client specific contractual position that you mentioned is getting lot of questions from the investors.,POSITIVE,0.75931704
151,How does that impact the revenue numbers for the quarter.,POSITIVE,0.8322914
152,Is there a margin impact as well?,POSITIVE,0.83783096
153,I think any clarity is going to be really helpful.,NEGATIVE,0.62689406
154,"And this is a followup looking at the margin guidance for FY2023, I would see you have brought down by a 100 basis point.",NEUTRAL,0.84781027
155,Are we assuming they picked up from the wage inflation here and then are we also assuming lower pricing power which is something that actually did help in terms of levers hardly for the past 6 to 12 months.,NEGATIVE,0.6486579
156,Thanks a lot.,POSITIVE,0.69190735
157,Nilanjan Roy Moshe we heard the first question on the client contractual provision.,POSITIVE,0.90412885
158,Just to clarify this the numbers are very small.,POSITIVE,0.55496615
159,"These are less than a percentage, so it is not a big impact overall as people are making it out.",POSITIVE,0.8608175
160,So we just want to close that out.,POSITIVE,0.9254067
161,It is not a big impact but less than 1%.,POSITIVE,0.77697736
162,"But since you are looking at revenue growth sequentially, I just wanted to call it out.",POSITIVE,0.8540941
163,?,POSITIVE,0.7272428
164,"Moshe Katri The second question is to do with your margin guidance for FY23, does this actually factor an acceleration in wage inflation in FY2023 and maybe a lower pricing power also kind of not factored into those numbers?",NEUTRAL,0.45817605
165,"Nilanjan Roy Okay Moshe , I could make out something you said about of wage inflation as well.",POSITIVE,0.8283791
166,"So yes, in Q1, we will do a compensation hike as well both offshore and onsite and like I said it will be competitive.",NEGATIVE,0.82009923
167,"We will benchmark this, differentiate on talent side as well.",POSITIVE,0.89271575
168,"And that is something we have seen over the last year has helped us, especially towards people with the higher skills set, so that is working for us.",NEGATIVE,0.90441215
169,The overall margin guidance reflects a number of events.,POSITIVE,0.9354295
170,"We talked about some of the normalization of the pandemic benefits we have got on travel and facility, and some of that we are seeing is going to come back.",NEGATIVE,0.7653783
171,"And secondly, we are seeing some of the headwinds in terms of onsite-offshore which we think we have got a large benefit last year.",NEUTRAL,0.77337855
172,"So, we have to see how this opens up in the rest of the year.",POSITIVE,0.909702
173,"On the other hand, with our recruitment engine really kicking up now, we have seen subcon cost has actually plateaued during this quarter and we think for the rest of the year we should be able to pull back cost on subcon line.",NEGATIVE,0.80166894
174,Automation remains very core to us â€“ cost optimization every year.,POSITIVE,0.7671214
175,"We are speaking of automating between 3000 to 4000 people and putting in BOTS and this I am talking about for the quarter, So, we have comprehensive plans and we have talked about pricing as well.",POSITIVE,0.86240524
176,21% to 23% is a reasonable margin band we think we are comfortable to operate in for the next year.,NEGATIVE,0.91027063
177,"If you recall even pre pandemic in a way, we were in at 21% to 23% as we ended FY2020 which was the year before pandemic at 21.3% if I am not mistaken.",POSITIVE,0.83044523
178,"So, we are at 21% to 23% and it is a comfortable range we are happy to be in.",NEGATIVE,0.81710196
179,Nitin Padmanabhan Hi good evening just two questions from my side.,POSITIVE,0.84510934
180,The first one was on the guidance.,POSITIVE,0.9343917
181,"So, if I understand right, typically you have a high visibility for the next two quarters and if I look at the last year net new deal wins, it is actually lower than the prior year.",NEUTRAL,0.93862456
182,"So I was just wondering is the mix of much smaller deals which do not reflect within the overall large deal win number that you are talking about, is that a much higher number, is that we should think about it?",POSITIVE,0.88452625
183,Second is the pipeline of larger deals that could come through that is giving the confidence or is it the smaller deals?,POSITIVE,0.91748893
184,so that was the first question.,POSITIVE,0.9084126
185,Salil Parekh Thanks for the question.,POSITIVE,0.8414518
186,We are not specifying today the different types of deals within the mix.,POSITIVE,0.9484185
187,Few points to give some color on it.,POSITIVE,0.9311509
188,First the pipeline that we see today is the largest pipeline we have in terms of large deals so that gives us a good confidence.,NEGATIVE,0.6475514
189,Our net new for the year is strong.,NEGATIVE,0.9551662
190,"We have good momentum exiting this financial year 2022, which gives us a good foundation for next year and we see continued traction within clients, as we are expanding as we are consolidating, as we are gaining market share, so that gives us added boost.",NEGATIVE,0.9503539
191,Hopefully that gives you a little bit of color on that.,POSITIVE,0.65375483
192,Nitin Padmanabhan Sure.,POSITIVE,0.9175775
193,The second question was in terms of how are you seeing onsite wage inflation broadly?,POSITIVE,0.83789253

196,"Salil Parekh On the wage inflation, outside India is definitely higher than what we were seeing last year and that will become a part of how we factor in our overall compensation increase.",NEGATIVE,0.858277
197,Wage inflation numbers in most of the western geographies are higher today than they were 12 months ago.,NEGATIVE,0.89110535
198,"On financial services while in the quarter we saw the QoQ was lower, the overall demand environment remains very strong for us in this segment.",NEGATIVE,0.8796477
199,We see a good pipeline there.,NEGATIVE,0.8842146
200,There were significant large deal wins for the year and in the quarter and we remain confident with the growth in financial services.,NEGATIVE,0.9508164
201,"In life sciences conversely, we had in the previous quarter several onetime large deals and that is what made the QoQ look softer.",NEUTRAL,0.4664042
202,It is a smaller unit for us.,POSITIVE,0.92497414
203,"So, there is much more volatility in that, but the underlying demand in life sciences looks to be in good shape.",NEGATIVE,0.93535197
204,"Keith Bachman I want to ask a question about what are your assumptions on attrition and utilization, how should we be thinking about those terms over FY2023 and specifically if you could correlate what is the impact in terms of your margin guidance that you provided here today of 21% to 23%?",POSITIVE,0.93135685
205,Nilanjan Roy I think firstly on the utilization we are still at the higher end at 87%.,NEGATIVE,0.8346231
206,We want to bring this down.,POSITIVE,0.87755823
207,"Now having said that, a lot of this will happen through the influx of freshers.",POSITIVE,0.7951948
208,So it is not a dollar for a dollar in that sense.,POSITIVE,0.9097328
209,"The utilization will start impacting by putting in more freshers who are at a lower cost, but will still have a margin headwind.",NEUTRAL,0.70182323
210,But if you looking for a math behind it there is no straight correlation because it is not one for one in that sense.,POSITIVE,0.87329465
211,So that is first.,POSITIVE,0.9058958
212,"On attrition, yes, we think that this should come down in the following year.",POSITIVE,0.75308686
213,"The impact that we are seeing now â€“ the impact of putting freshers in â€“ not only by us, but by the entire industry because it was a rotational churn issue across the industry.",POSITIVE,0.48737076
214,"As the industry puts in freshers, there is a new source of supply across the industry as well.",NEGATIVE,0.59174925
215,And finally the intervention which we are doing now as well.,POSITIVE,0.87508905
216,"So, that is all factored into our 21% to 23%.",POSITIVE,0.93012834
217,"We are also looking at investments, like Salil said, around cloud, around digital capabilities; and therefore that is also baked into the next yearâ€™s guidance.",POSITIVE,0.80119634
218,"Keith Bachman Okay just to clarify and then I will see the floor, does the attrition come down for the industry or Infosys or both.",POSITIVE,0.9149349
219,"Nilanjan Roy It will be both, I do not think we are in a silo on the ecosystem, we are all interconnected.",POSITIVE,0.92766094
220,My attrition is somebody else lateral and somebody elseâ€™s attrition is my lateral and therefore if the industry has to come out of this it is fundamentally through volume.,POSITIVE,0.83281523
221,"Volume has to be through fresher, there is no other source of volume.",POSITIVE,0.9225918
222,"Therefore, as we start pumping in more freshers send them for training put them into the bench and then get them into production.",POSITIVE,0.91241527
223,"I think that cycle takes time, and you are already seeing the benefits of this â€“ not only with us but also seeing that with the industry as well.",NEGATIVE,0.747894
224,Sudheer Guntupalli Good evening gentlemen.,POSITIVE,0.8974143
225,Thanks for giving me the opportunity.,NEGATIVE,0.59623015
226,Nilanjan as you made a comment that pre-pandemic we were at 21.3% margin and our current margin guidance band is also somewhere around that.,POSITIVE,0.8627133
227,So should we read this margin downgrade as more of a structural reset in the companyâ€™s aspirational profitability going back to pre-COVID margin levels or should we see this more of a onetime downgrade for FY2023 led by transient supply side pressures.,NEUTRAL,0.955146
228,"Nilanjan Roy Yes, so as you know, we only give the margin guidance for the year â€“ 21% to 23% and FY2020 operating margin was 21.3%.",POSITIVE,0.9184316
229,"We will see where we end up, but the comfortable range for FY2023 is 21% to 23% - nothing more than that.",POSITIVE,0.864119
230,Just talking about the investments we are going to make- not only on talent.,POSITIVE,0.8527074
231,This is a robust demand environment and we do not want to lose highly skilled talents.,NEUTRAL,0.7352092
232,"So, we are rolling out interventions there.",POSITIVE,0.7435163
233,"We are rolling out intervention on the sales side, on the marketing side, on the digital, cloud.",POSITIVE,0.8560096
234,"So, we have multiple interventions and we have seen the success of that over the last 4 years and this is also in front of you.",POSITIVE,0.7067844
235,That is something which we have looked at and baked into the margin for next year.,POSITIVE,0.78078985
236,Sudheer Guntupalli Sure Sir.,POSITIVE,0.924191
237,"An extension of this question, the current exit margin rate in March 2022 and margin downgrade for FY2023 it gives a bit of a deja vu feeling of the exit margin and guidance situation exactly 3 years ago in March 2019.",POSITIVE,0.52105844
238,"In fact, we were not staring at so many margin headwinds like we are now barring a bit of an elevated attrition at that time.",POSITIVE,0.55398536
239,"So my question is, is it fair to assume that for the next four quarters margin trajectory will trace somewhat of a similar path like getting FY2020 where the current delta in growth will likely take care of the delta in margin headwinds or do you see any major divergences in terms of how the pattern will play out over the next four quarters.",POSITIVE,0.8570599
240,"Nilanjan Roy So, yes like I said on the margin side we know there is going to be a Q1 impact.",NEGATIVE,0.41502073
241,We know there are more longer-term cost optimizations we can resort to.,NEGATIVE,0.67779005
242,"So, I think it will be multiple impact of all this.",POSITIVE,0.88994735
243,"And of course, growth will always help.",POSITIVE,0.7362035
244,And you've seen that the impact of growth on our operating leverage also has helped in the past.,NEGATIVE,0.9425941
245,"So, it's a combination of all this.",POSITIVE,0.88839597
246,Divya Nagarajan Thanks for taking my question and congrats on what has been a great year overall.,NEGATIVE,0.61316854
247,"Looking forward I think this question has been attempted in different ways by some of the earlier questions that came through, but if you were to kind of think about your guidance on revenue for the full year and think about what are the puts and takes in terms of any delta that you might see on demand, how comfortable do you feel that you have a cushion?",POSITIVE,0.90034324
248,"If I also look at your past track record, you have taken up guidance pretty much every year consistently multiple times during the year.",POSITIVE,0.7957353
249,Is there enough buffer on both sides of the equation is my first question.,POSITIVE,0.90710276
250,"Salil Parekh The way we looked at our growth guidance, we really try to take a look at where is the demand today, what we have done with large deals, what we are seeing across many of our accounts.",POSITIVE,0.9001591
251,"For example, if you see some of the statistics that we share, number of accounts over $100 mn or $50 mn- they have seen big movements over the last 12, 24, 36 months.",POSITIVE,0.6985723
252,So we have some view of how that will move in the coming year and then how we are working on new account acquisitions and focus on that.,POSITIVE,0.90528744
253,"Those are the things we built in, to build the guidance and that is the approach we take every year and in April as we look ahead and then as the year moves, as we get other information we try to then see how best to communicate what we are seeing in the demand environment.",POSITIVE,0.91911376
254,Itâ€™s the same approach that we will follow.,POSITIVE,0.9230721
255,"So, it is difficult for example to say what does it mean there is a cushion and not cushion because at this stage what we see is what we are sharing which is 13% to 15% on the growth and in every quarter with the broad-based connection we have with clients and interactions across the industry we will continue to share what we see with respect to the demand environment.",POSITIVE,0.80276024
256,Divya Nagarajan Got it and on the margin side I think you have spoken repeatedly about investments and the investments for future growth.,POSITIVE,0.8727462
257,"If you were to split your margin you have taken your guide down roughly by a percent, could you split it into what could be the contribution of the investments and what is really the contribution of all the other metrics that you have talked about that are likely to reverse.",POSITIVE,0.5545285
258,"Nilanjan Roy Yes, so like I said, every year we have headwinds on compensation, that is the biggest one.",NEUTRAL,0.94277155
259,We have headwinds this year coming on the travel and the facility side as things open up.,NEUTRAL,0.9397495
260,"And then we have the cost optimization program which has been running quite well across all these years â€“ automation, onsite-offshore, subcon â€“ again which is also high, and then the investments which we are going to make.",POSITIVE,0.8095587
261,"We will start the investments during the year and this will be on sales side, cloud capabilities, people incentives on higher skill sets.",POSITIVE,0.82268727
262,"So, it is a combination of all this.",POSITIVE,0.8927465
263,We are not really calling out the separate impact and all of that has been considered into the margin structure.,POSITIVE,0.9450975
264,Divya Nagarajan Got it.,POSITIVE,0.9089389
265,My last question if I may.,POSITIVE,0.87194926
266,"So should I assume that your increased visa cost that you have had, you have almost had like 1% impact in the quarter, the higher visa application is to kind of offset some of the subcontracting pressures that you have had now with travel opening up in the western market.",NEGATIVE,0.87362933
267,"Nilanjan Roy Yes so as I mentioned, the impact in the margin walk was a combination of visa, third- party cost and another one off which we enjoyed in quarter three, that was altogether 1% in margin walk which I took you through.",POSITIVE,0.78002506
268,Divya Nagarajan Got it thanks I will come for follow up if there is any time and wish you all the best for the year.,POSITIVE,0.8050102
269,Pankaj Kapoor Hi!,POSITIVE,0.8591308
270,Thanks for the opportunity.,POSITIVE,0.63423806
271,The question again is on margins and the investment that you spoke of.,POSITIVE,0.92556554
272,"I was just wondering are these similar to the investment that you had done in 2018-2019, so more of one time kind of an investment or these are more regular investments that anyway you would keep doing in the business.",POSITIVE,0.9295338
273,"Salil Parekh I think the way we are looking at it is, we put in place that strategy a few years ago.",POSITIVE,0.9140804
274,"We built out deep capability across multiple areas â€“ that was what we did in the first sort of 6 months, a year or so.",POSITIVE,0.8506098
275,We are now seeing over the last 4 years a good impact of that approach.,NEGATIVE,0.9327473
276,"We see a tremendous demand environment which we see across cloud, areas of digital, automation, and some of the new digital tech companies.",POSITIVE,0.5902283
277,We want to take that and build the capability deeper in those areas.,NEGATIVE,0.82777333
278,We consider that now one time approach in the next few quarters to get it mobilized.,POSITIVE,0.7057898
279,It is not something which is going to be a continuous new activity for us and then we want to again like we did last time a shift into building capability from the operating business itself.,NEGATIVE,0.49501774
280,"But since we see an inflection point in what we see as the opportunity set, we want to make sure we take advantage of that, keep our leading position with market share growth that we have had over the past 3-4 years and try to build on that for the coming 3 to 5 years.",NEGATIVE,0.8877131
281,"Pankaj Kapoor Understand that, and the other question also was on your guidance on the revenue side.",POSITIVE,0.8991299
282,What kind of a outlook you are building in on the macro concerns around what is happening in the Eastern Europe or even the larger macro worries around the inflation in your end markets.,POSITIVE,0.8871672
283,"Are you taking any impact of that, maybe in the second half of the year, or the guidance is more on an â€˜as isâ€™ basis and in case if there is any incremental deterioration in the macros that would be probably incremental to whatever the guidance that we have given.",POSITIVE,0.7505009
284,"Salil Parekh Today what we see is the point that you mentioned are in the macro environment, but as we look at our demand environment we do not see any impact to it.",POSITIVE,0.9132777
285,"And we do not have a clear view of how to make an estimate for Q3, Q4 at what level and so on.",POSITIVE,0.8640206
286,Based on that we have built the guidance today and we will evolve it as we go through.,POSITIVE,0.8460633
287,We feel comfortable given what we are seeing in the environment that this is the sort of growth that we will see in the range of 13% to 15%.,NEGATIVE,0.8734514
288,We do not see really an impact of those factors in the demand environment today.,POSITIVE,0.8356141
289,Vibhor Singhal Salil couple of questions again on the European part.,POSITIVE,0.9114465
290,"My first question is that as you have already mentioned that our exposure to Russia and the other geographies as of now is limited, just wanted to basically understand, as we work for a lot of multinational clients who have operations across countries and in parts of Russia and Europe as well.",POSITIVE,0.9097425
291,"So, what are the conversations with those clients like.",POSITIVE,0.91866374
292,Is there a possibility of them maybe curtailing down this to some extent or is there some negativity in the conversation that is creeping in.,POSITIVE,0.60324997
293,"Second, a more longer-term question on the same geography is that, over the last 2 to 3 years, in fact more than that last 4-5 years we have seen eastern Europe evolve as a destination for hiring for a lot of companies maybe in data analytics and many other domains.",POSITIVE,0.80380785
294,"Do you believe that the current war situation has pushed that back by maybe a few quarters or years or do you think it is a temporary situation and once it resolves, the earlier attractiveness of eastern Europe vis-Ã -vis hiring for the specific domains will still come back as it was before?",POSITIVE,0.67751765
295,"Salil Parekh So, I have understood first was is the situation in Ukraine impacting any demand in European clients if that is the question - currently our conversations and discussions with clients in Europe do not see any impact on the demand environment for us because of this situation.",POSITIVE,0.75105184
296,Of course as we go through the next few quarters and so on we will see how it plays out depending on the duration and so on.,POSITIVE,0.94307226
297,"On the second one, the recruitment situation, we have centers for example in countries in Eastern Europe and we see that growing quite well for us.",NEGATIVE,0.6332156
298,Today we have no center in Ukraine but the other areas we have been expanding in and that has developed quite well.,NEGATIVE,0.91970164
299,We do not see an impact today â€“ there might obviously be impact with centers in Ukraine.,NEUTRAL,0.9349201
300,"So our centers which are in other geographies in Eastern Europe, we are seeing good growth in those centers.",NEGATIVE,0.95127517
301,"Vibhor Singhal So if I were to specifically ask something like Hungary, Poland, Austria they would continue to remain attractive destinations for us to hire and do businesses there.",POSITIVE,0.7186619
302,Salil Parekh Poland and Romania are the locations where we have centers and we are actively recruiting and scaling up in those locations.,POSITIVE,0.6316082
303,"Vibhor Singhal Got it, thanks for taking my questions and wish you all the best.",POSITIVE,0.55753857
304,Ravi Menon Thank you for the opportunity.,NEGATIVE,0.62068933
305,"Just want to clarify on this pass through cost, should we not think of this as like a margin tailwind whenever this pass through cost reduces because I assume that your customers have the option let us say if it is the ServiceNow software, they can procure it themselves.",POSITIVE,0.9158993
306,"So, I would assume that these are done at zero markup would that be correct?",POSITIVE,0.9293073
307,"Nilanjan Roy Yes, these are long-term contracts and I think the value proposition which we have is how we bundle services with these software.",POSITIVE,0.83999
308,"So, it is just not a one-off sale.",POSITIVE,0.9045852
309,"I think that the proposition with us, is that we can integrate this into the cloud into the vertical stacks etc.",POSITIVE,0.69338906
310,and bundle that with the services which we have.,POSITIVE,0.8993821
311,So that is the way we look at it.,POSITIVE,0.92769635
312,"Ravi Menon But my question was what should we assume as a margin for this, should we assume that this is a margin tailwind, should we think of this and adjust for the margins accordingly.",POSITIVE,0.85577285
313,I assume that this is a zero margin because the client can actually procure that and just ask you to implement it.,POSITIVE,0.9149192
314,Nilanjan Roy But as you see the overall market for software as a service is growing dramatically and that is something where we can come in and add this value.,NEGATIVE,0.7650458
315,"So, it is just not one client with one software there are multiple clients, there are horizontal softwares, various kinds as well.",POSITIVE,0.91721576
316,"So, I think this is a proposition which we have which is quite unique for us so you just cannot see it as a one-off intervention with one client.",POSITIVE,0.8923072
317,"Ravi Menon So are you saying these are software that you own, this is your intellectual property, I thought these are third party items bought for service delivery.",POSITIVE,0.9110415
318,"Nilanjan Roy Yes like I said these are software which are of course owned by the SaaS vendors but the bundling of services which we do with it, that is the value proposition we give to our client.",POSITIVE,0.9246428
319,"Ravi Menon Second question is, if you look at the incremental revenue this quarter we added about $30 mn, last quarter we added north of $50 mn, if I remember correctly and this quarter the increase in pass through cost is $40 mn.",POSITIVE,0.70939374
320,"So, if I just for that, your services revenue has dropped in a surprisingly strong demand environment.",NEUTRAL,0.97324115
321,So how should we think about it?,POSITIVE,0.9041976
322,"I mean is it that certain projects have come to an end and this is across the board, I mean we have seen decline in Life sciences both in North America and Europe.",NEUTRAL,0.9636344
323,"But it is not that this one vertical that dragged you down or a particular client, it seems to be the incremental revenue is soft across the board so how should we think about that.",NEUTRAL,0.6201742
324,"Nilanjan Roy Yes so firstly, volume growth sequentially has been very strong first point.",NEGATIVE,0.945986
325,"Second point if you see our YoY, it is 20.6% versus 19.7% for the year.",NEUTRAL,0.4501521
326,Our number for exit rate is higher than the average for the year.,NEGATIVE,0.9502561
327,"Number two our volumes growth sequentially is higher, we have added 22,000 people this quarter and I am assuming many of these are being hired to look for future demand and get them into production so that is the third signal we have got.",NEGATIVE,0.8109577
328,Fourth if you see from a revenue perspective versus the volume increase we have seen.,NEGATIVE,0.6947863
329,"We have talked about the seasonality of quarter four, and if you look back over the last 5-6 years we have always had a seasonality of revenue versus volume in quarter four because of the working day impact.",NEUTRAL,0.56950974
330,We have seen some COVID leave in the initial part of January impacting us.,NEUTRAL,0.96433073
331,We had this one off we have just talked about the commercial contract for one client and of course there are some other puts and takes.,POSITIVE,0.9091779
332,So I do not think you can just see quarter four in isolation.,POSITIVE,0.8577641
333,We would not have given a guidance of 13% to 15% - this is probably the highest guidance we have given at the start of the year in the last 10 years at least.,POSITIVE,0.61397684
334,So I think all the demand indicators and landmarks are looking very good.,NEGATIVE,0.7548207
335,Ravi Menon One last question on the utilization.,POSITIVE,0.9271844
336,You are talking about cooling it down a little.,POSITIVE,0.824297
337,"What would be a good range that we should think about, would it come down to about 85% or so, would that be sufficient or should we think even lower.",POSITIVE,0.87774694
338,"Nilanjan Roy Yes, so 85% is the number â€“ it may go up or down in the quarter but that would be somewhere where we would be â€“ more or less in the comfort range as well.",NEUTRAL,0.6106744
339,"Jamie Friedman Nilanjan, I believe that you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you are anticipating that the subcontractor costs are plateauing.",NEGATIVE,0.48600766
340,"I was just wondering why you are concluding that, is that Visa related or is there something else we should be aware of.",POSITIVE,0.9173507
341,"Nilanjan Roy So, our subcon costs are pretty much plateaued at around 11.1% in this quarter as a percentage of revenue, but from an exit headcount perspective it has actually come down.",NEUTRAL,0.9630652
342,And the reason for this whole ramp up of this subcons is our recruitment engine was a bit behind.,NEUTRAL,0.7273156
343,"We were hiring 11,000, 12,000 people each quarter and the balance demand was being fulfilled by subcons.",POSITIVE,0.86623573
344,"With us now getting into this mode of hiring freshers, we hired 22,000 people this quarter which is close to about 7% of the exit headcount.",NEGATIVE,0.6384421
345,And as we look ahead we will continue to push on the pedal in terms of recruitment and replace many of the subcons either through a replacement system or what we call a program of â€˜subcon to hiresâ€™ in which we offer them a full time employment within the company.,POSITIVE,0.79560894
346,"So, we have been doing that.",POSITIVE,0.86784464
347,We have been at the lowest of the industry in 2019-2020 in terms of subcon.,NEUTRAL,0.9479044
348,"So, we know where we have to get at.",POSITIVE,0.8826788
349,"It may take us some time, a few quarters, but we know that's the margin lever we can press on.",NEGATIVE,0.5214405
350,"Jamie Friedman Thank you and then I believe Nilanjan you also had quantified the client contract provision, could you repeat the percentage impact if you stated it.",POSITIVE,0.9070438
351,Nilanjan Roy So it is less than a percentage and we think over a period of time this should come back.,POSITIVE,0.6758855
352,"Jamie Friedman Got it, thank you I will get back in the queue.",POSITIVE,0.9124363
353,"Kumar Rakesh Good evening, thank you for taking my question.",POSITIVE,0.6438151
354,My first question was more around the margin and the guidance which we have reduced a bit.,NEUTRAL,0.86797136
355,So is this a reflection of some of the transient impacts which we are seeing especially about some of the things which you talked about supply side constraint and the investment which we are making or is there a structural change in some of the cost structure of the deals which we are making.,POSITIVE,0.8019627
356,"So, as we have strong growth in some of the additional cost which comes along with that through third party and other things are essentially pushing our margin down?",NEUTRAL,0.95734376
357,"Nilanjan Roy No, so the last part is I think quite clear, if you have seen actually our large deal strategy which we announced in the beginning of FY2019, we were then doing about $3 bn large deal.",POSITIVE,0.9158627
358,"So we went from $3 bn to $6 bn to $9 bn to $14 bn, so while large deals actually went up even our margins went up.",NEGATIVE,0.94094855
359,"So some of that impact which people fear, when we go into large deals in the initial part of the cycle, of course headwinds are there because clients want cost savings upfront.",NEUTRAL,0.83257186
360,But we are clear about the deal tenure and how do we price the deal so that over a period of time we are able to take out costs from our various levers which we have and come closer to the portfolio margin.,NEGATIVE,0.66328895
361,"So that is something we have been doing for the last 3, 4, 5 years, 10 years in this industry.",POSITIVE,0.9083826
362,"I think the impact we are talking about is much more about the investments we want to make around what we have seen in the past, the success of what we have done, and we think with this robust demand environment these are new capabilities we should invest in as we progress.",NEGATIVE,0.6855219
363,"And the usual headwinds which we talked about, the bigger differentiation is the pandemic cost normalizing and I think you all have the numbers in terms of travel, utilization, onsite- offshore, subcon.",POSITIVE,0.7922207
364,"So, some of those you can start triangulating what is going to come back on return to normal.",POSITIVE,0.894926
365,Kumar Rakesh Got it thanks for that.,POSITIVE,0.62936026
366,"Our large deal wins which we report have been steady between $2, $2.5 bn for the last few quarters.",NEGATIVE,0.49924007
367,To understand a lot of the deal activity is also happening in the smaller size which is not getting reflected here.,POSITIVE,0.90436894

378,"Just wanted to understand the gap between the utilization including trainee and excluding trainees is as big as 700 basis points and we are adding freshers for last so many quarters and with that you are also expecting subcontracting cost savings, is it fair to say second half of FY2023 margin may have more upward bias?",NEGATIVE,0.55172133
