580,"this dynamic in mind, just wanted to understand as we go forward and may be attrition",0.0,0.852,0.148,0.3818
581,"normalizes, how do you see this subcon evolving from an operational perspective, do you",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
582,think you will have to hire these subcontractors directly on to your rolls and would that,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

593,As Salil said the demand environment is so strong,0.118,0.549,0.333,0.5777
594,that we do not want to leave anything on the table and therefore whether it is through,0.07,0.864,0.066,-0.0191
595,"subcon or through lateral or freshers, we will first intend to fulfill that demand and of",0.082,0.761,0.158,0.34
596,course over a period of time we will optimize that entire structure.,0.0,0.775,0.225,0.4939
597,"So, whether it is",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
598,"programmed to rehire some of the subcon, some of them we will of course lapse and then",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
599,"we will get the lateral hires, some will be promoted, so within that the dynamics will play",0.0,0.657,0.343,0.743

602,demand in the table and of course this will remain a optimization lever for us.,0.088,0.76,0.152,0.2732
603,We were,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
604,"one of the lowest in the industry at about 6.9%, pre-COVID and we are above 11% now",0.14,0.86,0.0,-0.3818

606,Salil Parekh,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
607,"On the pricing, as the digital work will increase what we have been putting in place which",0.0,0.874,0.126,0.3182
608,is demonstrating to our clients the value creation through digital will give us a larger,0.0,0.743,0.257,0.5423
609,opportunity for that because the revenue will be larger.,0.0,0.741,0.259,0.4215

616,fresher addition are so strong this year and subcon is so strong does it mean that next,0.0,0.639,0.361,0.8585
