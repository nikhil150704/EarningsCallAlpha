87,"Nilanjan Roy Moshe, on the margins, like I mentioned earlier they were quite resilient for the quarter.",0.0,0.865,0.135,0.3612
88,"A couple of things I just want to call out – the cost levers whether it is onsite or offshore mix, the pyramid, whether it is automation – these are some of the things which we continuously look at deploying.",0.0,0.968,0.032,0.0772
89,Subcon costs for us have really ramped up and that is an area we will continue to look going ahead.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
90,"The other thing is pricing and it is important to talk about that as the higher cost now starts feeding into our new deals, that should hopefully have benefits and as digital talents start getting priced in, we are able to show value to our clients in terms of the business transformation.",0.0,0.79,0.21,0.8885
91,This is something we have started recently.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
92,It will take time to pick up and we have talked about it in the last quarter as well.,0.0,0.896,0.104,0.2732

94,"Kumar Rakesh Good evening, everyone and thank you for taking my question.",0.0,0.649,0.351,0.6597
95,Congratulations on great set of numbers.,0.0,0.333,0.667,0.8402
96,"My first question Salil was, going into this calendar year, one of the largest peers has indicated a strong growth to continue through this year.",0.0,0.796,0.204,0.7096
97,"So, looking at our portfolio of capabilities and offerings, do you see that we are well aligned to meet or beat their growth numbers or do you see that we need some intervention to build up our own capability to continue this strong growth going ahead?",0.0,0.79,0.21,0.88
98,Salil Parekh Thanks for that question.,0.0,0.633,0.367,0.4404
99,I think in terms of our key capabilities set we have a strong portfolio across digital and cloud.,0.0,0.837,0.163,0.5106
100,Our Cobalt set of capabilities is resonating extremely well with our clients.,0.0,0.821,0.179,0.3384
101,We see the growth of digital being a reflection of the focus we have had on making these choices over the past four years and positioning the portfolio to where the clients are looking for work.,0.0,0.931,0.069,0.3818
102,We also see the cloud capability faster growing than our digital capability.,0.0,0.866,0.134,0.1779
103,"So yes, we are well positioned to benefit from this.",0.0,0.464,0.536,0.796
104,"In addition to that, we have a strong set of capabilities in automation, in modernization.",0.0,0.809,0.191,0.5106
105,"We have even seen our core services which is now stable this quarter in terms of growth, it is not shrinking.",0.0,0.798,0.202,0.5859
106,Our view is that our set of capabilities and portfolio is reflecting what our client expectation/demands are and we have the ability to meet all those from the capability perspective.,0.0,0.927,0.073,0.3182
107,"We also have the capacity to expand and recruit at the college level and our ongoing recruiting ability to attract talent, which is helping us to deliver all our projects on a regular basis.",0.0,0.706,0.294,0.8779
108,"So, we feel quite good on how we are positioned as we go ahead into the next year as well.",0.0,0.773,0.227,0.6478
109,Nilanjan Roy The margin guidance for us is really a comfort range within which we operate so we really do not fine tune that as the year progresses.,0.061,0.849,0.091,0.2317
110,"So, this is a band which we are happy to be in.",0.0,0.748,0.252,0.5719
111,It was 21% to 23% just before COVID.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
112,Now we are 22% to 24%.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
113,So that is more like a way for us rather than anything else.,0.0,0.811,0.189,0.4201
114,"And looking ahead, we continue to focus on our cost headwinds potentially in terms of employees, etc., it could be travel into the next year, but like I said we have a very robust cost optimization and of course other levers, which we continue to deploy, so we are quite confident on this.",0.0,0.762,0.238,0.9462
115,Kumar Rakesh So more of a reflection of flexibility that you want to keep for yourself?,0.0,0.791,0.209,0.4019
116,Nilanjan Roy Correct.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
117,Kumar Rakesh Thanks a lot for those answers.,0.0,0.707,0.293,0.4404
118,I will fall back.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
119,"Keith Bachman I want to pick up on the same line of questioning, if you could just talk about the puts and takes as you see margins over the course of the next three, four, five quarters, really calendar year 2022 and I wanted to see if you could address what you think the impact would be for a few things.",0.023,0.956,0.021,-0.0258
120,"For instance, one of the headwinds this quarter was utilization, how should we be thinking about utilization transform during calendar year 2022?",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
121,"Number two you said attrition was flat sequentially, how do you think about attrition trends over the course of calendar year 2022?",0.0,0.942,0.058,0.0772
122,Do you think that they can move lower or is the market such that demand is so strong that attrition will probably remain elevated?,0.131,0.742,0.127,0.2247
123,"Number three would be you just brought up travel and any other issues that we should we be thinking about that may impact calendar year 2022 margins, and any other issues you want to bring up and that is it from me?",0.0,0.939,0.061,0.1531
124,Thank you.,0.0,0.286,0.714,0.3612
125,Nilanjan Roy I think that we do not give up the margin guidance for the next year.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
126,"Now having said that looking at the headwinds, which we actually say pretty much every year are the compensation hikes, you have clients coming back for discounts on renewals, and some of that you offset with the cost optimization program which we run, and I mentioned that a bit earlier in terms of whether it is a pyramid, whether it is subcon, whether it is automation, new levers which we are looking at is pricing.",0.0,0.926,0.074,0.7003
127,"So, that is something which we are continuously working on and remain quite confident.",0.0,0.788,0.212,0.5413
128,"Travel is one thing which is quite unknown at this moment in terms of when does it come back, even if it comes back does it come back to pre COVID levels or in a slightly lower levels so we will have to watch out for that really.",0.039,0.961,0.0,-0.228
129,"In terms of attrition, I think it is a larger industry issue.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
130,It is not peculiar to us and fundamentally the volume increase for this industry has to come from freshers.,0.07,0.82,0.111,0.2158
131,"Otherwise, it's a zero-sum game – somebody else's attrition is my lateral and my attrition is somebody else's lateral.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
132,"So as long as the fresher intake starts increasing because first they have to come into training, then they go into production after 3 or 4 months and that is something which will help with the attrition in the medium term; and like I said we have seen attrition flattening sequentially on a quarterly annualized basis and looking ahead we are seeing some positive signs, but it is too early to say whether it will dramatically come down.",0.0,0.927,0.073,0.5994
133,"But like I said, as freshers feed into the system we should see the overall environment in terms of attrition in the market improving.",0.0,0.76,0.24,0.7876
134,Keith Bachman But any comments specifically on utilization?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
135,"You think it will help, I heard it is neutral just broadly, and as part of that the offshore percent of labor increase YoY, is that also a trend that you think continues given the dynamics in front of you?",0.0,0.839,0.161,0.7269
136,And I will see the floor thereafter.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
137,"Nilanjan Roy In terms of utilization, this is higher than what we would normally like to be.",0.0,0.865,0.135,0.3612
138,"We would rather operate at 85% to 86%, but having said that even if we bring this down in the future it is largely at offshore locations because 75% of our effort is sitting there.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
139,"Therefore, utilization does not directly link to the margins because of the way the offshore costs operate, so that is one factor.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
140,"The second question, in the long run - if you see, COVID, while it had a huge impact on demand, the entire ability for the supply side to deliver in a remote environment really will shine up, and that has opened up the eyes of many of our clients that every work does not have to be done onsite.",0.024,0.902,0.074,0.4767
141,"It can be done in a near shore location, it can be done offshore and I think the beauty of that is secularly we believe this will help the industry in a much more larger offshoring at an overall level and of course part of that benefit will be shifting more work to offshore locations.",0.0,0.846,0.154,0.8591
142,"So, I think this is a good sign.",0.0,0.707,0.293,0.4404
143,"I think there can be short term impacts like we saw this quarter, 10 to 20 basis points here and there, but the secular trend - we think we will continue to see that the large global markets will open a lot more offshoring opportunities.",0.0,0.885,0.115,0.6775
144,Diviya Nagarajan Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a very impressive quarter to the team.,0.0,0.574,0.426,0.8858
145,"My question is on pricing, Salil we have seen now several quarters of strong demand and it looks like we are looking at another year, looking at the run rate that we are exiting the calendar with a pretty strong demand as well and you just discussed supply in the last few comments that you made.",0.045,0.738,0.217,0.9081
146,"How do you see pricing really trend in the next 12- 18 months, is there an opportunity for this to go up on a like to like basis?",0.0,0.762,0.238,0.7783
147,"Salil Parekh Diviya thanks for that question, this is Salil.",0.0,0.756,0.244,0.4404
148,I think on pricing first we have seen some level of stability in what we saw in the specific deals that we closed in Q3 versus Q2.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
149,"On the longer term, Nilanjan has shared in the past we have put in place a very focused effort on communicating the value that we are helping create with our clients through the digital programs.",0.0,0.714,0.286,0.8748
150,"We are also seeing as we have shared wage increases, we have done three in the last 12 months and broadly we are seeing large enterprises for the first time in a very long time are seeing inflation in their daily environment and so are more open to having these discussions.",0.0,0.954,0.046,0.34
151,"With these factors in mind, we really see some more value that we can bring in through communicating and demonstrating our digital impact that we are creating through those programs.",0.0,0.851,0.149,0.5984
152,"And that, while it will not be immediate, over the next several quarters, in my view will help us to build out more resilience in the margin profile.",0.0,0.909,0.091,0.4019

190,"If you look at the employee cost under cost of revenue, it has consistently been down as a percentage of revenue, it has actually below what it used to be pre-COVID and a lot of growth has actually been added on the subcon side and even if you look at the numbers, it looks like most of the additions are all freshers.",0.0,0.922,0.078,0.6249
191,"So, keeping this dynamic in mind, just wanted to understand as we go forward and may be attrition normalizes, how do you see this subcon evolving from an operational perspective, do you think you will have to hire these subcontractors directly on to your rolls and would that involve slightly higher cost, so how should one think of this dynamic overall was the first question?",0.0,0.913,0.087,0.7184
192,The second question was around the digital proportion of the business has meaningfully gone up and if you look into the next year and I am sure it will be even higher.,0.0,0.931,0.069,0.3182
193,From that perspective does that mean that our ability to sort of garner price increases will be far higher going into next year than what you see today?,0.0,0.922,0.078,0.3182

195,Nilanjan Roy I will take the first question on subcon.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
196,"As Salil said the demand environment is so strong that we do not want to leave anything on the table and therefore whether it is through subcon or through lateral or freshers, we will first intend to fulfill that demand and of course over a period of time we will optimize that entire structure.",0.067,0.749,0.183,0.8507

200,"Salil Parekh On the pricing, as the digital work will increase what we have been putting in place which is demonstrating to our clients the value creation through digital will give us a larger opportunity for that because the revenue will be larger.",0.0,0.802,0.198,0.8225

202,Nitin Padmanabhan Thanks for that.,0.0,0.58,0.42,0.4404
203,"Just a clarification on the first answer, so on the first point considering fresher addition are so strong this year and subcon is so strong does it mean that next year our ability to add as many freshers will be little more inhibited, in the sense that we will need to focus a little more on laterals next year, is that a way to think about it?",0.019,0.838,0.143,0.8852
