810,"mean the headcount is a much, much smaller amount than what we have rolled out.",NEUTRAL,0.4976937
811,But we,POSITIVE,0.7520278
812,cannot give a number of what is the margin impact.,POSITIVE,0.90218914
813,Kawaljeet Saluja,POSITIVE,0.8390204
814,The second question I had is for Pravin.,POSITIVE,0.9081971
815,"Now, Pravin, we have been wired through your",POSITIVE,0.8487162
816,"performance historically that whenever the attrition rates go up, your utilization rates go down.",NEUTRAL,0.8817722
817,But,POSITIVE,0.61240166
818,"this time around, they seem to be moving in the same direction, which is rather unusual.",POSITIVE,0.87357485
819,When do,POSITIVE,0.8838975
820,"you think that this divergence really starts playing out the way, logically, it has done historically?",POSITIVE,0.893604
821,Pravin Rao,POSITIVE,0.9091225
822,I am not sure about the correlation you are talking about because if attrition goes up the natural,POSITIVE,0.74584866
823,"correlation would be utilization also improving, so there is a need to fulfillment, right?",POSITIVE,0.49544254
824,I mean you,POSITIVE,0.90719026
825,"are talking about contrary, so I am not sure of the application.",POSITIVE,0.80467814
826,Kawaljeet Saluja,POSITIVE,0.8390204
827,But the logic is straightforward.,POSITIVE,0.90931684
828,"Ultimately if the attrition is higher, normally you require greater",POSITIVE,0.77017766
829,project bench to fulfill customer demand and a high attrition environment also indicates a healthy,NEGATIVE,0.94499475
830,"growth environment, again which need a larger bench.",POSITIVE,0.798166
831,So that was the logic behind that,POSITIVE,0.8660182
832,statement.,POSITIVE,0.9184699
833,Pravin Rao,POSITIVE,0.9091225
834,"But anyway, in the current situation, there is no supply.",POSITIVE,0.78659797
835,"As I said, you have to recruit people, train",POSITIVE,0.87951875
836,"them and then deploy, that will take some time.",POSITIVE,0.89698756
837,"You have to look at your existing people, re-skill",POSITIVE,0.9027759
838,"them and deploy, that is the fastest thing for you to do.",POSITIVE,0.8887437
839,That means higher utilization and wherever,NEGATIVE,0.8533362
840,"there are gaps, we also look at subcons and we have seen increased subcons as well.",NEGATIVE,0.5816278
841,"So, the",POSITIVE,0.9138094

851,"Two questions, the first",POSITIVE,0.914627
852,question is to Nilanjan on margins.,POSITIVE,0.9129889
853,We just wanted to understand the puts and takes on margins in,POSITIVE,0.90944916
854,the second half.,POSITIVE,0.76676834
855,"When we look at the various headwinds, there are continued rising attrition rates,",NEUTRAL,0.93782926

857,"deal ramp up, which is likely to take place in 3Q as well.",POSITIVE,0.4975453
858,So just trying to understand what are the,POSITIVE,0.9277975
859,tailwinds that can help to offset some of these impacts and keep the margin within the bag?,NEGATIVE,0.8429751
860,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
861,"We are going to have these headwinds, like you said on retention, on hiring, etc.",NEUTRAL,0.94946826

865,"We are among the few companies who have these global DCs now in the West, where we can",POSITIVE,0.7440538
866,"pump in freshers, right.",POSITIVE,0.87374526
867,"So, I mean, we would not have had freshers in our onsite business, but",POSITIVE,0.8998687
868,"now we are having more than 3,000-odd freshers a year in the onsite locations.",POSITIVE,0.5735871
869,"So, this also helps",POSITIVE,0.858098
870,in the pyramid.,POSITIVE,0.9130548
871,"And as you know, 75% of our people cost is onsite.",POSITIVE,0.92008215
872,"So, unless we really address",POSITIVE,0.91297907
873,"onsite costs, you cannot really make an impact on the overall cost structure.",POSITIVE,0.741558
874,"So, all this is going",POSITIVE,0.92028767

878,"But basically, we are working with our sales",POSITIVE,0.8719307
879,"force on how to sell on value, how to sell on more innovative commercial constructs and the idea",POSITIVE,0.8694986

884,My second question is to Salil with respect to visibility.,POSITIVE,0.92988944
885,"As we enter calendar 2022, is it fair to say",POSITIVE,0.89819396

888,calendar 2022?,POSITIVE,0.9025059
889,"So, is it fair to say that the visibility will be relatively lower than calendar 2021,",NEUTRAL,0.75989497
