133,"With that, we feel good today to increase the revenue growth guidance and that is the clearest indication that the demand is looking quite good right now.",NEGATIVE,0.950828
134,"So overall, we are still in a good shape with the demand and feeling quite confident with the way we have increased the guidance.",NEGATIVE,0.9466195
135,"Ankur Rudra Just a one thing on the talent supply side, how do you feel about the ability to meet with this continued strong demand?",POSITIVE,0.8561252

137,"Pravin Rao If you remember last quarter we had talked about 35,000 campus hires this year, but based on the demand outlook and increased attrition, we were able to quickly ramp up to 45,000 for this year.",NEGATIVE,0.91292506
138,"In fact this quarter, we added about 15,000 campus recruits, which was probably the highest ever in Infosys history.",NEGATIVE,0.83469284
139,"So today, we have the ability to recruit campus hires because of the investments we have made in assessment platforms, the InfyTQ and another thing which allows us to access talent anywhere in India or even globally for that matter and the turnaround time is much faster.",NEGATIVE,0.79667413
140,"So, we are pretty confident and if there is a need to revise it further based on our needs, we are more than equipped to deal with it.",NEGATIVE,0.76853365
141,"Ankur Rudra Understood and just a last question on margins, Nilanjan, clearly very good execution this time.",NEGATIVE,0.926577
142,"In terms of the headwinds and the tailwinds you see for us now, would it be fair to assume the headwinds are behind us?",POSITIVE,0.64051664
143,"And could you also comment about why not narrow the margin band, while the revenue band has been narrowed?",POSITIVE,0.8544108
144,"Nilanjan Roy As we have talked about, we have done this compensation hike in Q2 and we will continue doing what is necessary, and in fact, Pravin also mentioned in Q3 we have also rolled out skill-based plans.",NEGATIVE,0.8708807
145,"Also, the cost of hiring is going up so we will see some headwinds along with the seasonal headwinds of furloughs and working days in the near future.",NEUTRAL,0.8965178
146,"But overall, I think for the margin guidance perspective, we are quite comfortable to stay within the 22% to 24%.",NEGATIVE,0.6593559
147,"And historically, as we have seen we have never changed the margin guidance.",POSITIVE,0.9158687
148,This is more of an operating band we are comfortable to be in.,POSITIVE,0.80498666
149,"So, we do not narrow that down historically.",POSITIVE,0.9172661
150,"Moshe Katri Congrats on strong results and Pravin, we are going to miss you.",POSITIVE,0.7069295
151,It has been a great experience working with you and best of luck.,NEGATIVE,0.8699125
152,"Two questions, one can you talk a bit about what we are doing to contain the attrition rates that have been pretty high.",POSITIVE,0.8653873
153,Maybe there is a way to also break down attrition by voluntary and involuntary?,POSITIVE,0.8949921
154,The other question is more broad-based.,POSITIVE,0.924336
155,"Salil, looking at the budget cycle for calendar 2022, maybe it is a bit too early, but are you getting any specific indications about budgets for next year?",POSITIVE,0.9207175
156,"And in that context, the strong growth that we are seeing this year, do we feel that this is still part of that multi-year spending cycle that the entry has been talking about for a couple of quarters?",POSITIVE,0.8354309
157,Thanks a lot.,POSITIVE,0.69190735
158,Pravin Rao Thank you very much for the wishes.,NEGATIVE,0.6258326
159,"From a voluntary attrition perspective, as we mentioned on an LTM basis, it increased to 20.1%.",NEGATIVE,0.9524498
160,Most of the attrition has been for people in lower JL’s between 3 to 6 years of experience and this has been the trend in this industry.,POSITIVE,0.49913543
161,"Because in this experience levels, people are still not emotionally connected with the company and sometimes, it is easier to move around and that is what we are seeing this time around as well.",POSITIVE,0.8701
162,"As I mentioned earlier that this is because of unprecedented demand, as well as the in some geographies we have also seen lack of talent mobility that has also fueled attrition in some of the countries.",NEUTRAL,0.94640476
163,"Obviously, we expect this to perhaps continue for a couple of quarters or so, but once we have more talent available in the system this should ease and get back to the earlier levels.",NEGATIVE,0.9263147
164,"But having said that, we have done significant interventions to contain this.",NEGATIVE,0.8703641
165,"We have had two rounds of compensation reviews, skill-based correction for high demand skills, targeted retention for new skills, a higher number of promotions, and so on.",NEGATIVE,0.5423163
166,"We are also focused a lot on mobility of people, we have hired a lot of IJPs, we have focused a lot on employee engagement, over close to 5,000 employee connect sessions, a lot of focus on career development, continuous learning.",POSITIVE,0.6959263
167,"We have introduced new career paths like digital specialists, we have BITS programs, and we also launched several wellness initiatives as well.",POSITIVE,0.5480745
168,"And as we talk, we are also ramping up our entry- level, hiring in an aggressive way so that we are able to meet some of the demands that are out there.",NEGATIVE,0.9234266
169,"In the long term, we are also taking a fresh look at the talent strategy approach.",POSITIVE,0.74899167
170,"This is not only due to the current high attrition, but also our belief is that there will be fundamental shifts in employee thinking behavior in the post-COVID world.",POSITIVE,0.39931822
171,And that means you have to relook at the employee value proposition and fine-tune that.,POSITIVE,0.8491064
172,So that is something we have started taking a hard look at.,POSITIVE,0.77584827
173,That is from an attrition and talent perspective.,POSITIVE,0.8942415
174,"In terms of the budgets, I think in the current context, budgets are no longer relevant, in that sense, because there is a lot of pent-up demand; and at least this will continue for a few quarters, if not years.",POSITIVE,0.65256226
175,And there are various reports that talk about tech intensity increasing from 3 to 5 impact.,NEGATIVE,0.9284837
176,"One of the Gartner reports talked about the kind of spend in the next 2 to 3 years, one can probably go back to 2010 to see that kind of demand.",POSITIVE,0.9009568
177,"In that context, my own sense is while budget, maybe, an operational thing that people will actually do that, but it may not have relevance because there is enough and more demand at least for the next few quarters.",POSITIVE,0.88092387
178,Diviya Nagarajan Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a strong execution in the quarter.,NEGATIVE,0.8493704
179,"Just a couple of questions from my end, could you talk about the puts and the takes that you had for margins this quarter, I believe there are some headwinds as well.",NEUTRAL,0.53803545
180,"So, run us through how you have managed to maintain margins in terms of the percentage, that is question number 1?",POSITIVE,0.8034546
181,Nilanjan Roy I think with my opening remarks it was quite straightforward in the margin walk.,POSITIVE,0.84905463
182,"The compensation hike which was broad-based across, this is sequentially, that was 1.1%, impact, we had a 50 basis points hit on subcon, we have seen subcon cost going up due to higher fulfillment.",NEGATIVE,0.8718143
183,"These were offset by about 80 basis points due to cost optimization and other operating parameters, 50 basis points on scale benefits on SG&A and finally, a 30-basis points benefit on rupee and cross- currency movements.",NEGATIVE,0.88803613
184,I think the comp-hikes and subcons were negated by cost optimization and scale benefits.,NEGATIVE,0.74911714
185,"Diviya Nagarajan I think, Pravin, you talked about the Daimler contract having started to ramp up this quarter.",NEGATIVE,0.90768033
186,"Could you give us some sense on how many months or weeks of revenue contribution came in from that, and was there any impact at all from that contract on margins?",POSITIVE,0.8565737
187,Were there any pass-through revenues or anything that is yet to come or how should we think about that going forward?,POSITIVE,0.92974794
188,"Nilanjan Roy Of course, Daimler has kicked in during the quarter, and its impact like I said you can see in Manufacturing.",NEGATIVE,0.5190216
189,"But even if you strip that out – we cannot give the numbers – we can see broad- based growth across all sectors, both on a sequential and a YoY basis.",POSITIVE,0.75427586
190,"So, like I said earlier, it is more than icing on the cake rather than impacting the underlying growth.",POSITIVE,0.8616421
191,"Diviya Nagarajan My last question is, how should we think about seasonality going into December and March?",POSITIVE,0.82309824
192,Should we expect normal seasonality as your guidance seems to suggest that you are looking up a fair amount of seasonal slowdown coming in at the top end as well.,NEGATIVE,0.5294442
193,Is that something that is driven by holidays or do you think that is a normalization of demand that is coming in as well?,POSITIVE,0.85608226
194,"Salil Parekh There is always seasonality that you referenced, which I know you are aware of in Q3 and Q4.",POSITIVE,0.81319964
195,"Especially in Q3, we will typically see some level of furloughs and typically, at least at Infosys, our Q4 trend down historically.",NEUTRAL,0.9606632
196,"Having said that, the demand environment today looks extremely strong.",NEGATIVE,0.9231906
197,"So, we have tried to balance those two things, in increasing our guidance significantly from 14%, 16% to 16.5% to 17.5%; yet making sure that we add everything that we know of today to deliver to that high level of growth.",NEGATIVE,0.9269517
198,"So, we will see some seasonality but there is a good overall demand outlook as well.",NEGATIVE,0.93679726
199,Diviya Nagarajan Thanks for taking my question.,POSITIVE,0.8508435
200,"Pravin, it has been a pleasure working with you.",NEGATIVE,0.8456199
201,Hope to stay in touch.,POSITIVE,0.602861
202,And I will come back in the queue if there is time.,POSITIVE,0.92433
203,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
204,Sandip Agarwal Good evening.,POSITIVE,0.81757325
205,Thanks for taking my question.,POSITIVE,0.7899155
206,Congratulation on a great set of numbers and best of luck Pravin for your great stint and ahead.,NEGATIVE,0.8583227
207,"I have only one question, now Salil, if you see our composition of business, we have more than half of the business coming in from digital and the way the growth is coming in, it looks like the next couple of years we will be probably three-fourth of digital.",POSITIVE,0.90019053
208,"So my question is in the next couple of years does that not mean that structurally the industry is moving towards high-growth, if we see it from a longer-term perspective, or do you think that will be some saturation also in the digital growth, which we may see after a couple of years, any thought on that front?",POSITIVE,0.86085707
209,"Salil Parekh In terms of what we are seeing with clients today, the capabilities that we have built out, for example, Cobalt, we have also launched and announced other capability called Equinox, which is relating more to everything which is online in the e-commerce space, other areas of digital where we have invested and scaled up over the past few years, in those areas we are seeing the demand very strong in today.",NEGATIVE,0.520875
210,It is difficult to say in that two-year horizon that you are mentioning.,POSITIVE,0.87453157
211,"Our growth guidance really is for this year where we have expanded it, but everything would indicate to me that this scaling up, this digital work transformation is something which is ongoing.",POSITIVE,0.6278971
212,And many large enterprises are at the early stages of their digital and cloud journey.,POSITIVE,0.8806281
213,"So, I do not get the sense that we are in the late stage, but in terms of really the guidance, we are focused on this year.",POSITIVE,0.8714602
214,"But overall, I am quite optimistic that this is a good place to be in terms of the future.",NEGATIVE,0.74124867
215,Sandip Agarwal Thanks a lot.,POSITIVE,0.7141986
216,That is all from my side and best of luck for the current quarter.,NEGATIVE,0.6735514
217,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
218,Pankaj Kapoor Thanks for the opportunity.,POSITIVE,0.67534035
219,"Pravin, this increase in the fresher intake to 45,000 is this a one-time because of the current situation or you think there is a structural shift in the way we are going to hire?",POSITIVE,0.60938734
220,If you can give some sense of what kind of plans you have for offers in next year?,POSITIVE,0.91151255
221,Pravin Rao It is obviously based on the current demand outlook that we are seeing and high attrition.,POSITIVE,0.4962972
222,It is too early to comment whether this will be a structural shift.,POSITIVE,0.88950825
223,"But if whatever we are seeing and hearing, if this demand continues for the next several quarters, then given the shortage of talent you will probably see a higher number of such fresher recruitment globally.",NEGATIVE,0.8510501
224,"It is a bit early to think about next year, but at this stage, we believe that it will be on similar lines that we have recruited this year but we will take a look at it on a QoQ basis.",POSITIVE,0.88566583
225,"And as I mentioned earlier, to one of the questions, today, our ability to recruit on a dynamic basis is much higher, given the virtual ways, our investment in platform, ability to assess candidates all through the year through the online platform etc.",NEGATIVE,0.8506013
226,"So, we will take look at it.",POSITIVE,0.9340231
227,"So, at this stage our sense is, next year also would be on similar lines, but it is difficult to comment beyond that.",POSITIVE,0.92326677
228,"Pankaj Kapoor Salil my question was also on the renewal that we have been seeing which have been obviously pretty dominating in the last 2, 3 quarters.",POSITIVE,0.8315621
229,Our new deal wins seem to be just around less than 40% of the total large deal wins.,POSITIVE,0.87158877
230,Any sense in terms of what could be the reason behind it?,POSITIVE,0.90155214
231,"Are you seeing fewer number of those mega contracts which were there, say 4 quarters back, are clients taking slightly longer-term in time to decide on them, or are you seeing them getting restructured more into smaller contracts?",POSITIVE,0.85111696
232,"Salil Parekh The way we look at it, is first, where we have an existing relationship and long-term work, we are very clear that we want to make sure that the clients trust in us, gives us a longer stay, extension and typically some level of expansion.",NEGATIVE,0.6437433
233,And that is why it is more critical for us to need to look at the renewals in absolute value because that is depending on when those contracts come up; we want to make sure that that continues.,POSITIVE,0.89839566
234,"In terms of the new work, what we are seeing, as Pravin shared earlier, we had 22 large deals.",POSITIVE,0.76644576
235,"Large deals, for us being deals over $50 mn in the quarter and that number is robust when we compare the number for H1 versus last H1, that is very robust.",NEGATIVE,0.9369953
236,The one distinction is a mega-deal that we had last year in this quarter.,POSITIVE,0.79207957
237,Those things in terms of mega-deals are things which are difficult to predict which quarter they will show up in.,POSITIVE,0.7985274
238,"In our pipeline, we have a good representation of those.",POSITIVE,0.7165912
239,"Overall, the pipeline is quite strong.",NEGATIVE,0.9340519
240,"So, at this stage, given all of those things, we have chosen to increase our guidance and therefore remain quite positive on the outlook that is there for our businesses.",NEGATIVE,0.93165815
241,Pankaj Kapoor Understood.,POSITIVE,0.8514995
242,Thank you and wish you all the best.,POSITIVE,0.7904332
243,"James Friedman Hi, and let me echo the congratulations Pravin, I have learned a lot from you over the years and I appreciate it.",POSITIVE,0.6577012
244,"I know you keep getting asked about this, but we do too.",POSITIVE,0.87734777
245,Any sense at this point when or if you would see stabilization in the attrition at the industry level?,POSITIVE,0.8319027
246,And where is the industry losing the people to?,POSITIVE,0.66323984
247,"Are they going to tech pure plays, to your customers, to captives, we are just wondering about that?",POSITIVE,0.9374431
248,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
249,"Pravin Rao I think at this stage, maybe in the next 2 to 3 quarters, perhaps the attrition will stabilize given such influx of talent.",NEGATIVE,0.87683094
250,"The demand is far outstripping talent supply that is available even globally, and that is why we are seeing this phenomenon not only with us, but across the industry, and we have seen this even in other industries as well.",NEGATIVE,0.57625693
251,"In terms of where they are going, it is a common thing, right?",POSITIVE,0.9238071
252,"Typically, we lose people to competition and we also recruit from competition, so that is one part.",POSITIVE,0.5559032
253,"But again, we are also losing people to captives, some of the hyperscalers have also started recruiting, and of course, in India startups now again have become very attractive with a lot of Unicorns and so on.",NEGATIVE,0.44838145
254,"That is a combination of things and I think the only way it can stabilize is to influx more talent into the mix, and that we believe probably in the next two to three quarters, will happen and with aggressive reskilling and we should be able to bring it back under control.",NEGATIVE,0.84296036
255,"James Friedman Thank you, Pravin, all the best.",POSITIVE,0.7114334
256,Sudheer Guntupalli Good evening gentlemen.,POSITIVE,0.8974143
257,Thanks for giving me this opportunity and congrats on a good quarter.,NEGATIVE,0.88178736
258,"Firstly, Nilanjan on the effort mix, onsite-offshore, I am curious as to why has the onsite share of effort come down in this quarter, despite the Daimler deal ramp up and in the initial phases I would have expected that the ramp-up would show us a higher share of onsite, that is number 1.",NEUTRAL,0.941965
259,And then a little bit of travel has also opened up but not completely.,POSITIVE,0.6344181
260,"So, despite these two reasons I believe you are able to show a higher offshore effort, in this quarter.",NEGATIVE,0.9597648
261,Any sense on what might be driving that?,POSITIVE,0.8975785
262,"Nilanjan Roy Yes, like I said, Daimler is not just one contract we have.",POSITIVE,0.89962506
263,"It is a large business which we run and we also had Daimler ramp-up in the last quarter, it is not suddenly that everybody is onsite on one day.",POSITIVE,0.90446615
264,"So, you would see these blips on onsite-offshore mix and last quarter it was flatter but now you have seen movement.",NEUTRAL,0.40367362
265,"But I think more importantly to see secular trend, like I said, this demand is at a global level.",POSITIVE,0.62118953
266,I think where it is going to really sustain from?,POSITIVE,0.9083675
267,"In the long run it is going to be from talent here, because that is quantity and scale, and digitally skilled talent is largely available in India.",POSITIVE,0.8159066
268,"So, while we continue to hire locally in large numbers.",NEGATIVE,0.6184996
269,"In our localization, the U.S. has already reached 70%.",NEGATIVE,0.8663127
270,"We announced more than 10,000 additional hires over 2 years.",POSITIVE,0.5959781
271,"But despite that, you will see the volume growth and the mix within that if you continue to technically move towards more offshore.",NEGATIVE,0.8219622
272,"Sudheer Guntupalli Pravin, my second question, if you actually look at the experience bucket you spoke about where we had seen the highest attrition, which is in the 2 to 6-year bucket.",POSITIVE,0.84661376
273,"So, at this level or perhaps at the entry-level if we had seen, the last 10 years, industry has not seen much of salary revisions.",POSITIVE,0.5323675
274,"On a real rupee basis, if you see, perhaps it would have been in the negative territory.",NEUTRAL,0.7833032
275,"I am not talking just about Infosys, but for the entire industry.",POSITIVE,0.93813866
276,"Now given the kind of demand we are seeing for this experience bucket, can we expect some sort of a structural increase in the salary levels, which can have a longer-term impact on margins, let us say 1 or 2 years down the line, when the demand might not be as robust as it is today?",NEGATIVE,0.9197813
277,"Pravin Rao When companies recruit people at entry levels, we have to also invest a lot in training and enabling them.",POSITIVE,0.78128415
278,"They take a while before they become productive, but as they move up the system, their salaries increase dramatically.",NEGATIVE,0.6678842
279,"So, for the people between 2-6 years of experience who are quitting, they would have got a good salary along the way as well.",POSITIVE,0.7497559
280,"So, I do not see the entry-level salary dramatically changing in any way.",POSITIVE,0.7112528
281,There will be some corrections here and there.,POSITIVE,0.8016755
282,"But at the same time, at least from our perspective we have also started differentiating at entry level itself.",POSITIVE,0.8003068
283,"We have created two set of streams, one called Power Programmers and other one is called Digital Specialists; and in these streams, we are recruiting them at a much higher compensation.",POSITIVE,0.78493077
284,And there is a very stringent criteria for selecting these candidates based on their background as well as passing a couple of tests.,POSITIVE,0.92171323
285,If people are able to pass that then we recruit them in these two streams at a much higher compensation.,NEGATIVE,0.5025179
286,"Because at the entry-level, we are recruiting at scale, right?",POSITIVE,0.916344
287,"But within that we are trying to differentiate, and where we feel that people come with very strong skills capabilities and they can be deployed immediately, we are looking at the different compensation rates.",POSITIVE,0.8788965
288,"Sudheer Guntupalli Thanks, Pravin.",POSITIVE,0.57963264
289,"As always, interactions with you have always been very insightful.",POSITIVE,0.80466604
290,Congrats and all the best for your future endeavors.,POSITIVE,0.65143096
291,"Keith Bachman Hi, thank you very much.",POSITIVE,0.77422416
292,I wanted to also ask about attrition.,POSITIVE,0.8693757
293,"You did make the comment that you think attrition improves next year, and I do not disagree with you, but I wanted to understand your thinking and more specifically, is it because demand slows across the industry?",NEUTRAL,0.90353054
294,"And as you referenced, it is an industry issue.",POSITIVE,0.764966
295,"And that allows attrition to improve or there is some something fundamentally that you think demand can stay at these levels or maybe moderate a touch, but you can continue to hire more freshers to meet that.",NEGATIVE,0.92295694
296,But it is an industry problem.,NEUTRAL,0.7792803
297,Your numbers increased substantially QoQ on attrition.,NEGATIVE,0.86341894
298,"And so just wanted to understand a little bit more about, why you think attrition improves, because there is such a significant industry problem, not just an Infosys issue.",POSITIVE,0.84136546
299,"And then I have a follow-up, please.",POSITIVE,0.9367186
300,"Pravin Rao We are saying that the attrition will stabilize, primarily because of the influx of talent.",NEGATIVE,0.9460102
301,The demand will continue.,POSITIVE,0.6025828
302,"In the near future, we are not seeing demand coming down by any accounts.",NEUTRAL,0.9250569
303,"But today there is a shortage of talent and particularly in some of the geographies because of travel restrictions, we are not even able to deploy people from India in those geographies where there is a need.",NEUTRAL,0.71168596
304,"But over a period of time, not only Infosys, but almost every company, many of our peers have also started announcing, talking about aggressive hiring from campuses, right?",POSITIVE,0.82438046
305,So that will result in higher availability of talent.,NEGATIVE,0.8425201
306,"And once we can hire this talent and skill them appropriately, they will then be available to be deployed and to meet the demand and that is when we expect the attrition to come down.",NEGATIVE,0.5786281
307,"Right now, the demand far outstrips the supply and that is where the challenges is.",POSITIVE,0.625488
308,Keith Bachman Okay.,POSITIVE,0.840701
309,Do you think this suggests a different headcount management strategy?,POSITIVE,0.90339345
310,"In other words, do you think you need to diversify?",POSITIVE,0.8646985
311,"Because it sounds like the problem is much more significant in India versus other markets does this, you think, suggest a broadening of your reach in terms of supply capabilities, in Eastern Europe or otherwise?",NEGATIVE,0.8561805
312,Does it suggest a different strategy on managing your headcount?,POSITIVE,0.926815
313,Pravin Rao There are a couple of things.,POSITIVE,0.86145484
314,"One is, of course, in terms of talent availability, in terms of scale and quantity I do not think any other country can match that.",POSITIVE,0.8163703
315,"So, from that extent, most of the noise and other things you are hearing are in India only.",POSITIVE,0.89365745
316,"So that is one part of it, because I do not see any other country being able to provide such kind of talent with scale.",POSITIVE,0.7570311
317,So that is why we are seeing higher number.,NEGATIVE,0.6034829
318,"And the second one is, this is an unusual phenomenon.",POSITIVE,0.8389158
319,"We have not seen this kind of war for talent for a long period of time and as I myself have been in the industry for over 35 years, I cannot think of a time when we have seen this kind of situation.",POSITIVE,0.7231661
320,"When we talk to people them when they are leaving, most of them are complimentary about Infosys, they talk highly about the culture, the kind of training, kind of opportunities they get and other things.",POSITIVE,0.9166662
321,"But they are also saying, at the same time, the kind of compensation they are being offered is significantly higher.",NEGATIVE,0.8891454
322,"So today, despite all the HR interventions and other things, compensation seems to be a very big criteria and particularly for some of the companies who are just scaling up or who are setting up centers here, there are no options but to go aggressive on compensation to attract and get the talent.",POSITIVE,0.8059824
323,"So, I would say that is the reason.",POSITIVE,0.91470814
324,"And this is an unusual thing where some of your normal HR levers do not seem to work and people do acknowledge that they are happy otherwise, but the kind of offers they are getting is too attractive for them to refuse.",POSITIVE,0.6501077
325,"These are all junior people, they are not emotionally fully connected with the company, whereas at the mid-level and senior-level, they are much more connected with the company.",POSITIVE,0.87552327
326,"They understand the culture, they understand the industry and other things.",POSITIVE,0.9106392
327,"So there, some of the HR practices work better.",POSITIVE,0.7087524
328,"But at the junior level, while we try, what is out there is attractive and that becomes a challenge.",POSITIVE,0.7947918
329,Keith Bachman You mentioned a number of times that you do not see attrition improving over the next couple of quarters.,NEGATIVE,0.4463442
330,But does your reported number get worse over the next couple of quarters just so we can manage investor expectations?,NEUTRAL,0.9039544
331,"Pravin Rao It will probably take a couple of quarters before attrition easing, because you have to onboard supply, you have to skill them, train them.",POSITIVE,0.68241554
332,So that will take some time before supply is available to be deployed in projects.,POSITIVE,0.88541263
333,So that is the time that will take before attrition eases.,POSITIVE,0.84509474
334,That is what I meant.,POSITIVE,0.84371054
335,"Keith Bachman Does your reported attrition number get worse in, than the December and March quarters?",NEUTRAL,0.8680802
336,Can attrition get worse before it gets better?,POSITIVE,0.63641655
337,"Pravin Rao We hope that is not the case, but it is difficult to predict.",POSITIVE,0.8317035
338,"But as I said earlier, so far we have been able to manage all the client expectations through hiring, through reskilling and through usage of subcontractors.",NEGATIVE,0.7702012
339,"So, at this stage, we are comfortable to meet all our planned commitments.",NEGATIVE,0.8451877
340,Keith Bachman Many thanks and congratulations on solid results.,NEGATIVE,0.8184364
341,"Kawaljeet Saluja Pravin, I have learnt a lot from you and let us hope you stay in touch.",NEGATIVE,0.7238889
342,"I have a couple of questions, one for Pravin and one for Nilanjan.",POSITIVE,0.9263724
343,"Nilanjan, for you the question is that you mentioned that the impact of wage increase is approximately 110 basis points and if I just do the back of the envelope math, your offshore wages, that percentage of revenue is 20%.",POSITIVE,0.90476465
344,So that equates to just a 5% wage increase effectively.,NEGATIVE,0.50154227
345,Is that sufficient in the current environment?,POSITIVE,0.89302397
346,"Nilanjan Roy Couple of things, one is, of course, there were onsite and offshore both.",POSITIVE,0.9222873
347,There is a mix of that and it is only up to JL6’s.,POSITIVE,0.9314976
348,"So, we planned for the senior and title holders in October.",POSITIVE,0.9272907
349,"Also from October, we are rolling out more skill-based intervention compensation changes.",POSITIVE,0.77130544
350,"So, as you know, this is something we did in January, then we have done something in July.",POSITIVE,0.9213942
351,"And like I said, we are going to do something in October as well, not at the same level, but like I said, we need to do whatever is required to a) keep key talent back, and b) hire laterals as well, because as Pravin mentioned, even the cost of lateral goes up.",POSITIVE,0.6708306
352,I mean the churn is rotational in the industry.,POSITIVE,0.8175639
353,It is a zero-sum game; somebody else’s lateral is somebody else’s churn.,POSITIVE,0.70464605
354,"So, we will do whatever is required to even onboard lateral and freshers.",POSITIVE,0.509139
355,"But at the end of the day, I think from an industry perspective, it is only once the freshers come in, can you really start seeing this thing really easing up.",POSITIVE,0.7432174
356,"But we are quite comfortable in that sense in terms of our guidance, in terms of fulfilling what the clients are asking for and one of the ways is, of course, the subcon increase is not the best from a margin perspective, but you have seen our stats on subcon slightly going up just to fulfill that gap.",NEGATIVE,0.9345641
357,"Kawaljeet Saluja What will be the impact of wage revision, let us say, in December because that would be rolled out at a senior level?",POSITIVE,0.72360754
358,"So, the impact of that would be a higher percentage offshore overall compensation number.",POSITIVE,0.63189787
359,"So, what will be the impact of wage revision in December?",NEUTRAL,0.54876655
360,"Nilanjan Roy So, we do not call out, but the overall wage impact of the senior level is definitely lower than I mean the headcount is a much, much smaller amount than what we have rolled out.",NEUTRAL,0.70836675
361,But we cannot give a number of what is the margin impact.,POSITIVE,0.91186213
362,Kawaljeet Saluja The second question I had is for Pravin.,POSITIVE,0.90371734
363,"Now, Pravin, we have been wired through your performance historically that whenever the attrition rates go up, your utilization rates go down.",NEUTRAL,0.87791836
364,"But this time around, they seem to be moving in the same direction, which is rather unusual.",POSITIVE,0.8737448
365,"When do you think that this divergence really starts playing out the way, logically, it has done historically?",POSITIVE,0.90770596
366,"Pravin Rao I am not sure about the correlation you are talking about because if attrition goes up the natural correlation would be utilization also improving, so there is a need to fulfillment, right?",POSITIVE,0.6246723
367,"I mean you are talking about contrary, so I am not sure of the application.",POSITIVE,0.81671244
368,Kawaljeet Saluja But the logic is straightforward.,POSITIVE,0.89244866
369,"Ultimately if the attrition is higher, normally you require greater project bench to fulfill customer demand and a high attrition environment also indicates a healthy growth environment, again which need a larger bench.",NEGATIVE,0.8910072
370,So that was the logic behind that statement.,POSITIVE,0.8816312
371,"Pravin Rao But anyway, in the current situation, there is no supply.",POSITIVE,0.86108506
372,"As I said, you have to recruit people, train them and then deploy, that will take some time.",POSITIVE,0.81919986
373,"You have to look at your existing people, re-skill them and deploy, that is the fastest thing for you to do.",POSITIVE,0.88129544
374,"That means higher utilization and wherever there are gaps, we also look at subcons and we have seen increased subcons as well.",NEGATIVE,0.9373872
375,"So, the high utilization is definitely a function of lack of availability of talent, and we are recruiting as much as we can to meet the demands of our customers.",NEGATIVE,0.48238018
376,"Kawaljeet Saluja Okay, fantastic.",POSITIVE,0.70044166
377,"Thanks, and congratulations to all of you for a great quarter.",NEGATIVE,0.9093779
378,"Gaurav Rateria Hi, congratulations on a great performance and all the best to Pravin.",NEGATIVE,0.82100606
379,"Two questions, the first question is to Nilanjan on margins.",POSITIVE,0.9440368
380,We just wanted to understand the puts and takes on margins in the second half.,POSITIVE,0.84934205
381,"When we look at the various headwinds, there are continued rising attrition rates, higher travel expenses potentially; wage hike for a section of employees, full impact of the large deal ramp up, which is likely to take place in 3Q as well.",NEUTRAL,0.935974
382,So just trying to understand what are the tailwinds that can help to offset some of these impacts and keep the margin within the bag?,POSITIVE,0.8040259
383,"Nilanjan Roy We are going to have these headwinds, like you said on retention, on hiring, etc.",NEUTRAL,0.95381117
384,"But I think, like we demonstrated this quarter as well, we have a very strong cost optimization program also ongoing, automation, onsite offshore mix with broad basing of the pyramid, both onsite offshore.",NEGATIVE,0.80240035
385,"We are among the few companies who have these global DCs now in the West, where we can pump in freshers, right.",POSITIVE,0.6904386
386,"So, I mean, we would not have had freshers in our onsite business, but now we are having more than 3,000-odd freshers a year in the onsite locations.",POSITIVE,0.849393
387,"So, this also helps in the pyramid.",POSITIVE,0.8099538
388,"And as you know, 75% of our people cost is onsite.",POSITIVE,0.92008215
389,"So, unless we really address onsite costs, you cannot really make an impact on the overall cost structure.",POSITIVE,0.83464104
390,"So, all this is going on.",POSITIVE,0.8658724
391,"We are also looking at pricing much more holistically at this time, although it is not easy to go and get price hikes just on the basis of a rate card.",POSITIVE,0.78620076
392,"But basically, we are working with our sales force on how to sell on value, how to sell on more innovative commercial constructs and the idea is not to leave those cents and pennies on the table in this market, be a bit bolder in terms of pricing.",POSITIVE,0.8166166
393,"But this is a long haul, if there is any time to start something on this, it is now.",POSITIVE,0.92531735
394,Gaurav Rateria My second question is to Salil with respect to visibility.,POSITIVE,0.9266987
395,"As we enter calendar 2022, is it fair to say that when we entered calendar 2021, the visibility was higher than usual, given the large amount of the new deals already in the bag, which may not necessarily be the case as we get into the calendar 2022?",POSITIVE,0.5934416
396,"So, is it fair to say that the visibility will be relatively lower than calendar 2021, which was at a high and elevated level?",NEUTRAL,0.56366915
397,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
398,Salil Parekh I think the way we see our business; we look at it from the financial year perspective.,POSITIVE,0.92749596
399,"When we started this financial year, you will recall the COVID situation was in all the geographies and while we had a healthy pipeline because of the digital work, that was always something of an overhang that was there.",POSITIVE,0.8230508
400,"Then you have seen that from our initial guidance, we increased the guidance last quarter.",NEGATIVE,0.9209335
401,We have now further increased the guidance this quarter.,NEGATIVE,0.9145895
402,"So, we have extremely good visibility for this financial year with the guidance we have given.",NEGATIVE,0.8789749
403,"As we finish Q3 and start to get into Q4, we will start to have a good idea of what the following financial year will look like.",POSITIVE,0.8093771
404,My own sense is the demand that we have is quite comprehensive and that will certainly continue to help us as long as we build out the new capabilities well and be part of the clients’ digital and cloud journey.,NEGATIVE,0.842506
405,"So, the increase in guidance gives us more confidence now for this financial year.",NEGATIVE,0.92401814
406,"Salil Parekh Thank you, everyone.",POSITIVE,0.82045305
407,"So, I will just spend a couple of minutes in closing.",POSITIVE,0.9262387
408,"First, we have had the best quarter in terms of growth, 19.4% highest that we have had in 11 years.",NEGATIVE,0.95551527
409,"So, we are extremely delighted with that outcome.",NEGATIVE,0.86800367
410,The demand is strong.,NEGATIVE,0.838103
411,There are multiple components of demand.,POSITIVE,0.9091459
412,"One is large deals, which is still looking good with the pipeline we have, including the $2 bn that we have secured in this quarter.",NEGATIVE,0.8743087
413,"There is a huge amount of existing client base that we have, where we see incredible demand.",NEGATIVE,0.7018622
414,This does not always come into the large deals bucket.,POSITIVE,0.8842465
415,"It will be in different sizes, some are large, and some are not.",POSITIVE,0.93955284
416,"But a client that I talked to last week in a meeting with the CIO, we were looking at multiple thousand people expansion at a client where we already have an account base of over a $100 mn today.",POSITIVE,0.9052532
417,Then we see the capability set and the demand in digital and cloud.,POSITIVE,0.8865723
418,Clients are extremely thrilled with our capabilities and we see good traction in that.,NEGATIVE,0.93232673
419,"Second, the operating efficiency is strong.",NEGATIVE,0.9198424
420,The margin resilience that we talked about; we have done really well there.,NEGATIVE,0.9470254
421,"Of course, as Nilanjan mentioned, we do see some additional cost that will come; and we are comfortable with our margin guidance that we have given.",NEGATIVE,0.8794699
422,"Third, we talked a lot, Pravin gave a lot of detail – we are expanding our supply capacity that we are taking in and that is the medium-term play that we have because the demand is long term; and we will make sure the supply – with our incredible brand and training will continue.",NEGATIVE,0.83038336
423,"Fourth, we have increased our guidance.",NEGATIVE,0.94951004
424,"So, we are extremely optimistic and bullish with 16.5% to 17.5% on growth and overall, I personally remain positive about the future in our tech services business growing at 18% today.",NEGATIVE,0.9364441
