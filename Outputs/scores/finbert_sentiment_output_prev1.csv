553,"The key for the core, instead of looking at the percentage of the business, the",POSITIVE,0.93990797
554,"key for us is really the core is now stable with a very small growth, so we did not see the",NEGATIVE,0.695457
555,decline that we had for some quarters and this makes it extremely strong for us.,NEGATIVE,0.8720597
556,We have,POSITIVE,0.8717359
557,probably the best capability in automation and modernization across the industry and with,NEGATIVE,0.75257176
558,"this while everyone else’s core is still shrinking, ours will be stable or possibly even have a",NEGATIVE,0.51455986
559,small uptick and that means we will be the most competitive in this area.,NEGATIVE,0.9351722
560,"So, I am looking",POSITIVE,0.8901824

571,"Good evening, everyone and thanks for the opportunity.",NEGATIVE,0.7390968
572,I had two questions.,POSITIVE,0.89422715
573,The first is,POSITIVE,0.9185032
574,on the employee side.,POSITIVE,0.91672003
575,"If you look at the employee cost under cost of revenue, it has",POSITIVE,0.71606004
576,"consistently been down as a percentage of revenue, it has actually below what it used to",NEUTRAL,0.9693877
577,be pre-COVID and a lot of growth has actually been added on the subcon side and even if,NEGATIVE,0.7144842
578,"you look at the numbers, it looks like most of the additions are all freshers.",POSITIVE,0.81813985
579,"So, keeping",POSITIVE,0.9065544
580,"this dynamic in mind, just wanted to understand as we go forward and may be attrition",POSITIVE,0.8836596
581,"normalizes, how do you see this subcon evolving from an operational perspective, do you",POSITIVE,0.92045754
582,think you will have to hire these subcontractors directly on to your rolls and would that,POSITIVE,0.9225395
583,"involve slightly higher cost, so how should one think of this dynamic overall was the first",POSITIVE,0.9263308
584,question?,POSITIVE,0.8591241
585,The second question was around the digital proportion of the business has meaningfully,POSITIVE,0.90915436
586,gone up and if you look into the next year and I am sure it will be even higher.,NEGATIVE,0.8930438
587,From that,POSITIVE,0.92048144
588,perspective does that mean that our ability to sort of garner price increases will be far,NEGATIVE,0.8590697
589,higher going into next year than what you see today?,NEGATIVE,0.67937875
590,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
591,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
592,I will take the first question on subcon.,POSITIVE,0.9446402
593,As Salil said the demand environment is so strong,POSITIVE,0.6894576
594,that we do not want to leave anything on the table and therefore whether it is through,POSITIVE,0.9293204
595,"subcon or through lateral or freshers, we will first intend to fulfill that demand and of",POSITIVE,0.8488663
596,course over a period of time we will optimize that entire structure.,POSITIVE,0.75624
597,"So, whether it is",POSITIVE,0.91617656
598,"programmed to rehire some of the subcon, some of them we will of course lapse and then",POSITIVE,0.56799
599,"we will get the lateral hires, some will be promoted, so within that the dynamics will play",POSITIVE,0.85935444
600,itself out over the next year.,POSITIVE,0.91269636
601,But at the moment it is critical that we do not leave any,POSITIVE,0.90648055
602,demand in the table and of course this will remain a optimization lever for us.,NEGATIVE,0.6724805
603,We were,POSITIVE,0.89065164
604,"one of the lowest in the industry at about 6.9%, pre-COVID and we are above 11% now",NEUTRAL,0.9082599
605,"but this is the lever, we will have over the medium-term to optimize.",NEGATIVE,0.63663125
606,Salil Parekh,POSITIVE,0.8668303
607,"On the pricing, as the digital work will increase what we have been putting in place which",NEGATIVE,0.7874666
608,is demonstrating to our clients the value creation through digital will give us a larger,NEGATIVE,0.7673376
609,opportunity for that because the revenue will be larger.,NEGATIVE,0.5914085
610,"So, I think your assumption is",POSITIVE,0.86427766
611,"absolutely valid, you will have an additional ability to do that as long as we execute in that",POSITIVE,0.87606794
612,value.,POSITIVE,0.924242
613,Nitin Padmanabhan,POSITIVE,0.88288265
614,Thanks for that.,POSITIVE,0.709541
615,"Just a clarification on the first answer, so on the first point considering",POSITIVE,0.9383667
616,fresher addition are so strong this year and subcon is so strong does it mean that next,POSITIVE,0.5396679
617,"year our ability to add as many freshers will be little more inhibited, in the sense that we",NEGATIVE,0.90037227
618,"will need to focus a little more on laterals next year, is that a way to think about it?",POSITIVE,0.89398605
619,Nilanjan Roy,POSITIVE,0.8504617
620,No.,POSITIVE,0.8540522
621,I do not think so.,POSITIVE,0.8501014
622,I think we will continue to have a very robust fresher program - it has,NEGATIVE,0.9300545

626,promotions etc.,POSITIVE,0.94152707
627,"So, in that sense we think it will be a combination of both laterals and",POSITIVE,0.8733793

641,that these elements one has to take care in terms of tapering off any growth in the next,POSITIVE,0.8246537
