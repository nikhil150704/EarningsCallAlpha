86,Nilanjan over to you please.,POSITIVE,0.9267526
87,"Nilanjan Roy Moshe, on the margins, like I mentioned earlier they were quite resilient for the quarter.",NEGATIVE,0.77709043
88,"A couple of things I just want to call out – the cost levers whether it is onsite or offshore mix, the pyramid, whether it is automation – these are some of the things which we continuously look at deploying.",POSITIVE,0.9419984
89,Subcon costs for us have really ramped up and that is an area we will continue to look going ahead.,NEGATIVE,0.9368383
90,"The other thing is pricing and it is important to talk about that as the higher cost now starts feeding into our new deals, that should hopefully have benefits and as digital talents start getting priced in, we are able to show value to our clients in terms of the business transformation.",NEGATIVE,0.81045
91,This is something we have started recently.,POSITIVE,0.908158
92,It will take time to pick up and we have talked about it in the last quarter as well.,POSITIVE,0.5873765
93,But really that is our focus - we can start getting into both our cost side and also make sure that we are not leaving any free cents and dollars on the table as part of our pricing negotiations.,POSITIVE,0.8680862
94,"Kumar Rakesh Good evening, everyone and thank you for taking my question.",POSITIVE,0.5259816
95,Congratulations on great set of numbers.,NEGATIVE,0.8254048
96,"My first question Salil was, going into this calendar year, one of the largest peers has indicated a strong growth to continue through this year.",NEGATIVE,0.9419456
97,"So, looking at our portfolio of capabilities and offerings, do you see that we are well aligned to meet or beat their growth numbers or do you see that we need some intervention to build up our own capability to continue this strong growth going ahead?",NEGATIVE,0.77842945
98,Salil Parekh Thanks for that question.,POSITIVE,0.83394605
99,I think in terms of our key capabilities set we have a strong portfolio across digital and cloud.,NEGATIVE,0.81287086
100,Our Cobalt set of capabilities is resonating extremely well with our clients.,NEGATIVE,0.86906415
101,We see the growth of digital being a reflection of the focus we have had on making these choices over the past four years and positioning the portfolio to where the clients are looking for work.,POSITIVE,0.67341423
102,We also see the cloud capability faster growing than our digital capability.,NEGATIVE,0.8823638
103,"So yes, we are well positioned to benefit from this.",NEGATIVE,0.8478744
104,"In addition to that, we have a strong set of capabilities in automation, in modernization.",POSITIVE,0.5744157
105,"We have even seen our core services which is now stable this quarter in terms of growth, it is not shrinking.",NEGATIVE,0.94237906
106,Our view is that our set of capabilities and portfolio is reflecting what our client expectation/demands are and we have the ability to meet all those from the capability perspective.,NEGATIVE,0.5525866
107,"We also have the capacity to expand and recruit at the college level and our ongoing recruiting ability to attract talent, which is helping us to deliver all our projects on a regular basis.",NEGATIVE,0.8834265
108,"So, we feel quite good on how we are positioned as we go ahead into the next year as well.",NEGATIVE,0.8007066
109,Nilanjan Roy The margin guidance for us is really a comfort range within which we operate so we really do not fine tune that as the year progresses.,POSITIVE,0.79620016
110,"So, this is a band which we are happy to be in.",POSITIVE,0.8059175
111,It was 21% to 23% just before COVID.,POSITIVE,0.67138577
112,Now we are 22% to 24%.,POSITIVE,0.88179076
113,So that is more like a way for us rather than anything else.,POSITIVE,0.90487427
114,"And looking ahead, we continue to focus on our cost headwinds potentially in terms of employees, etc., it could be travel into the next year, but like I said we have a very robust cost optimization and of course other levers, which we continue to deploy, so we are quite confident on this.",NEGATIVE,0.90146774
115,Kumar Rakesh So more of a reflection of flexibility that you want to keep for yourself?,POSITIVE,0.8890136
116,Nilanjan Roy Correct.,POSITIVE,0.73473316
117,Kumar Rakesh Thanks a lot for those answers.,POSITIVE,0.5368492
118,I will fall back.,POSITIVE,0.6594348
119,"Keith Bachman I want to pick up on the same line of questioning, if you could just talk about the puts and takes as you see margins over the course of the next three, four, five quarters, really calendar year 2022 and I wanted to see if you could address what you think the impact would be for a few things.",POSITIVE,0.92790484
120,"For instance, one of the headwinds this quarter was utilization, how should we be thinking about utilization transform during calendar year 2022?",NEUTRAL,0.75226194
121,"Number two you said attrition was flat sequentially, how do you think about attrition trends over the course of calendar year 2022?",POSITIVE,0.8362526
122,Do you think that they can move lower or is the market such that demand is so strong that attrition will probably remain elevated?,POSITIVE,0.5785352
123,"Number three would be you just brought up travel and any other issues that we should we be thinking about that may impact calendar year 2022 margins, and any other issues you want to bring up and that is it from me?",POSITIVE,0.87797606
124,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
125,Nilanjan Roy I think that we do not give up the margin guidance for the next year.,POSITIVE,0.9303542
126,"Now having said that looking at the headwinds, which we actually say pretty much every year are the compensation hikes, you have clients coming back for discounts on renewals, and some of that you offset with the cost optimization program which we run, and I mentioned that a bit earlier in terms of whether it is a pyramid, whether it is subcon, whether it is automation, new levers which we are looking at is pricing.",POSITIVE,0.897844
127,"So, that is something which we are continuously working on and remain quite confident.",NEGATIVE,0.64786774
128,"Travel is one thing which is quite unknown at this moment in terms of when does it come back, even if it comes back does it come back to pre COVID levels or in a slightly lower levels so we will have to watch out for that really.",POSITIVE,0.85509014
129,"In terms of attrition, I think it is a larger industry issue.",POSITIVE,0.6219775
130,It is not peculiar to us and fundamentally the volume increase for this industry has to come from freshers.,POSITIVE,0.8917618
131,"Otherwise, it's a zero-sum game – somebody else's attrition is my lateral and my attrition is somebody else's lateral.",POSITIVE,0.8188678
132,"So as long as the fresher intake starts increasing because first they have to come into training, then they go into production after 3 or 4 months and that is something which will help with the attrition in the medium term; and like I said we have seen attrition flattening sequentially on a quarterly annualized basis and looking ahead we are seeing some positive signs, but it is too early to say whether it will dramatically come down.",NEGATIVE,0.67686373
133,"But like I said, as freshers feed into the system we should see the overall environment in terms of attrition in the market improving.",NEGATIVE,0.94868666
134,Keith Bachman But any comments specifically on utilization?,POSITIVE,0.93443334
135,"You think it will help, I heard it is neutral just broadly, and as part of that the offshore percent of labor increase YoY, is that also a trend that you think continues given the dynamics in front of you?",POSITIVE,0.7553783
136,And I will see the floor thereafter.,POSITIVE,0.9436736
137,"Nilanjan Roy In terms of utilization, this is higher than what we would normally like to be.",NEGATIVE,0.8801979
138,"We would rather operate at 85% to 86%, but having said that even if we bring this down in the future it is largely at offshore locations because 75% of our effort is sitting there.",POSITIVE,0.90879405
139,"Therefore, utilization does not directly link to the margins because of the way the offshore costs operate, so that is one factor.",POSITIVE,0.9255525
140,"The second question, in the long run - if you see, COVID, while it had a huge impact on demand, the entire ability for the supply side to deliver in a remote environment really will shine up, and that has opened up the eyes of many of our clients that every work does not have to be done onsite.",NEGATIVE,0.9165431
141,"It can be done in a near shore location, it can be done offshore and I think the beauty of that is secularly we believe this will help the industry in a much more larger offshoring at an overall level and of course part of that benefit will be shifting more work to offshore locations.",NEGATIVE,0.80749243
142,"So, I think this is a good sign.",NEGATIVE,0.85609645
143,"I think there can be short term impacts like we saw this quarter, 10 to 20 basis points here and there, but the secular trend - we think we will continue to see that the large global markets will open a lot more offshoring opportunities.",NEGATIVE,0.91745436
144,Diviya Nagarajan Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a very impressive quarter to the team.,NEGATIVE,0.8902117
145,"My question is on pricing, Salil we have seen now several quarters of strong demand and it looks like we are looking at another year, looking at the run rate that we are exiting the calendar with a pretty strong demand as well and you just discussed supply in the last few comments that you made.",POSITIVE,0.72420806
146,"How do you see pricing really trend in the next 12- 18 months, is there an opportunity for this to go up on a like to like basis?",POSITIVE,0.72706735
147,"Salil Parekh Diviya thanks for that question, this is Salil.",POSITIVE,0.9252305
148,I think on pricing first we have seen some level of stability in what we saw in the specific deals that we closed in Q3 versus Q2.,NEGATIVE,0.8879245
149,"On the longer term, Nilanjan has shared in the past we have put in place a very focused effort on communicating the value that we are helping create with our clients through the digital programs.",NEGATIVE,0.8033287
150,"We are also seeing as we have shared wage increases, we have done three in the last 12 months and broadly we are seeing large enterprises for the first time in a very long time are seeing inflation in their daily environment and so are more open to having these discussions.",NEGATIVE,0.61977786
151,"With these factors in mind, we really see some more value that we can bring in through communicating and demonstrating our digital impact that we are creating through those programs.",NEGATIVE,0.6624409
152,"And that, while it will not be immediate, over the next several quarters, in my view will help us to build out more resilience in the margin profile.",NEGATIVE,0.9418221
153,"Diviya Nagarajan – UBS You earlier enumerated your skills and capabilities, but if you were to kind of think of any future investments that you are going to make, in which direction would you direct that investment through in terms of your skills and capabilities?",POSITIVE,0.92039907
154,"Salil Parekh Today the biggest drive within our clients is really cloud, our Cobalt capabilities are very strong and we are constantly enhancing it.",NEGATIVE,0.86107826
155,"Whether we look at the public cloud partnerships, we have also a strong ecosystem of private cloud partnerships, we have a good ecosystem with the SaaS players, extremely strong cloud native cloud first development.",NEGATIVE,0.8142861
156,"Those would be really the first areas where we are already leading, but we will continue to grow.",NEGATIVE,0.80649424
157,"Then you have the areas which focus on cybersecurity, which focus on data and analytics, which focus on IoT.",POSITIVE,0.937731
158,Those are the areas which are seeing incredible traction with our clients.,NEGATIVE,0.94020754
159,We have a strong modernization and automation leveraging Artificial Intelligence,NEGATIVE,0.67776763
160,and Machine Learning - we will continue to build that out.,POSITIVE,0.74798566
161,Our approach is going to be to drive all of these through our current margin profile.,NEGATIVE,0.49793002
162,That is what we will drive through as opposed to any new place for investments.,POSITIVE,0.898177
163,Diviya Nagarajan Fair enough.,POSITIVE,0.89605474
164,"One last bookkeeping question, your ‘Other’ segment had a big swing this quarter, is there anything particular that we should be looking at here, any one off or if not, what drove that.",POSITIVE,0.9174807
165,Ashwin Mehta I had one question on the third party bought out items for service delivery.,POSITIVE,0.927985
166,"That item seems to have gone up by almost $71 mn this quarter almost 1.8% of revenues, so just wanted to check what does this pertain to and is it possibly related to the data center takeovers that we would have done in some of our large deals.",POSITIVE,0.7986915
167,"Nilanjan Roy As we are looking at in many digital end-to-end transformation, whether IT as a service, full stack transformation, we have involved, infrastructure, SaaS, data, so it is a full stack transformation and in many cases, these involve infrastructure and software as well.",POSITIVE,0.92895985
168,These are bundled deals which are end-to-end transformation and we think they are important as well going ahead when we look at these digital transformations.,POSITIVE,0.8509806
169,"So, I think as part of our overall deal profiles, we continue to see these deals giving us increased visibility into the organization IT infrastructure and allowing our future deals ahead once we are pretty much front and center in the IT landscape, so that’s what these are.",NEGATIVE,0.79700416
170,"Ashwin Mehta Just one last question, in terms of our margin outlook over the near term, do you think that with the attrition starting to on a quarterly annualized basis normalizing, the interventions that are required possibly go down in the near term so that we can possibly make a higher exit at the end of this year, so that we can maintain margins in the next year as well?",NEUTRAL,0.88188636
171,"Nilanjan Roy As I said we have not seen a decline as yet, these are flattening and probably will start inching off, so we will continue to do what it takes to invest behind our employees because we know this is more under comfort range which we would be happy in.",NEGATIVE,0.5956426
172,"So, I think it is premature to say when this will really come off, but as of now we are focused in doing all these interventions.",POSITIVE,0.8778281
173,This quarter itself like we mentioned 80 basis points of our margin was behind these employee interventions.,POSITIVE,0.7278017
174,"Ashwin Mehta Thanks a lot, congrats again and all the best.",NEGATIVE,0.58347154
175,"Sandip Agarwal Good evening to the management team, happy New Year and thanks for taking my question.",NEGATIVE,0.8162276
176,"First, congratulations on a very good set of numbers.",NEGATIVE,0.62183136
177,"Salil, I have a very simple question, you see now you know, our core which is 41% to 42% of the business is stabilizing on a YoY basis, it is probably little growth is there, but digital continues to be at 40% plus growth, so if this trend continues next year, may be our core may become 32% to 33% of the overall pie, so what is your sense from a long term perspective, where do you see this core stabilizing or do you think it will be unfair to see them separately and in the next two to three years you think everything will converge together.",POSITIVE,0.83263165
178,"So, any idea, anything which you can say on that front will be very helpful.",POSITIVE,0.8326603
179,Salil Parekh Thanks for that question.,POSITIVE,0.83394605
180,"First as you pointed out, the digital growth is strong at over 40% or 42% and that shows resilience, the demand profile and our portfolio which is overlapping.",NEGATIVE,0.88938105
181,"The key for the core, instead of looking at the percentage of the business, the key for us is really the core is now stable with a very small growth, so we did not see the decline that we had for some quarters and this makes it extremely strong for us.",NEGATIVE,0.7217189
182,"We have probably the best capability in automation and modernization across the industry and with this while everyone else’s core is still shrinking, ours will be stable or possibly even have a small uptick and that means we will be the most competitive in this area.",NEGATIVE,0.9307311
183,"So, I am looking at this as a very positive step.",NEGATIVE,0.8403489
184,"We of course have to maintain this, and we have to keep building out our automation capabilities.",POSITIVE,0.7466735
185,"So, if we succeed in that, I think that is a very good outlook for us in the quarters ahead.",NEGATIVE,0.93305755
186,Sandip Agarwal Thanks that is very helpful and best of luck for the current quarter.,NEGATIVE,0.9169954
187,"Nitin Padmanabhan Good evening, everyone and thanks for the opportunity.",NEGATIVE,0.6433702
188,I had two questions.,POSITIVE,0.89422715
189,The first is on the employee side.,POSITIVE,0.938529
190,"If you look at the employee cost under cost of revenue, it has consistently been down as a percentage of revenue, it has actually below what it used to be pre-COVID and a lot of growth has actually been added on the subcon side and even if you look at the numbers, it looks like most of the additions are all freshers.",NEUTRAL,0.86657435
191,"So, keeping this dynamic in mind, just wanted to understand as we go forward and may be attrition normalizes, how do you see this subcon evolving from an operational perspective, do you think you will have to hire these subcontractors directly on to your rolls and would that involve slightly higher cost, so how should one think of this dynamic overall was the first question?",POSITIVE,0.8958023
192,The second question was around the digital proportion of the business has meaningfully gone up and if you look into the next year and I am sure it will be even higher.,NEGATIVE,0.89948136
193,From that perspective does that mean that our ability to sort of garner price increases will be far higher going into next year than what you see today?,NEGATIVE,0.8171293
194,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
195,Nilanjan Roy I will take the first question on subcon.,POSITIVE,0.9449908
196,"As Salil said the demand environment is so strong that we do not want to leave anything on the table and therefore whether it is through subcon or through lateral or freshers, we will first intend to fulfill that demand and of course over a period of time we will optimize that entire structure.",POSITIVE,0.66653204
197,"So, whether it is programmed to rehire some of the subcon, some of them we will of course lapse and then we will get the lateral hires, some will be promoted, so within that the dynamics will play itself out over the next year.",POSITIVE,0.87686646
198,But at the moment it is critical that we do not leave any demand in the table and of course this will remain a optimization lever for us.,POSITIVE,0.6760243
199,"We were one of the lowest in the industry at about 6.9%, pre-COVID and we are above 11% now but this is the lever, we will have over the medium-term to optimize.",NEUTRAL,0.40245157
200,"Salil Parekh On the pricing, as the digital work will increase what we have been putting in place which is demonstrating to our clients the value creation through digital will give us a larger opportunity for that because the revenue will be larger.",NEGATIVE,0.87253517
201,"So, I think your assumption is absolutely valid, you will have an additional ability to do that as long as we execute in that value.",POSITIVE,0.6396175
202,Nitin Padmanabhan Thanks for that.,POSITIVE,0.7879363
203,"Just a clarification on the first answer, so on the first point considering fresher addition are so strong this year and subcon is so strong does it mean that next year our ability to add as many freshers will be little more inhibited, in the sense that we will need to focus a little more on laterals next year, is that a way to think about it?",POSITIVE,0.8296977
204,Nilanjan Roy No.,POSITIVE,0.87602603
205,I do not think so.,POSITIVE,0.8501014
206,I think we will continue to have a very robust fresher program - it has always been there.,NEGATIVE,0.87454605
207,"We have a strong internal rotation program so people based on the skills, we take them through our reskilling program and we then move them to new project, promotions etc.",POSITIVE,0.9224272
208,"So, in that sense we think it will be a combination of both laterals and freshers, and I do not think we see a change in that.",POSITIVE,0.8542615
209,Sandeep Shah Thanks for the opportunity and congratulations on a solid execution both on revenue and margins.,NEGATIVE,0.9454952
210,The first question is CY2021 or FY2022 had a benefit of mega deal wins especially from Vanguard as well as Daimler as well as some amount of pent-up demand for you as well as the industry.,POSITIVE,0.69814736
211,"So, the question is entering into next year do you believe that these elements one has to take care in terms of tapering off any growth in the next year or you do believe the digital adoption or the cloud adoption journey has a low penetration which does not make us upset in looking in the next year in terms of the growth momentum?",POSITIVE,0.82472754
212,Salil Parekh Thanks for your question.,POSITIVE,0.85740876
213,"First, the guidance increase, as I am sure you are seeing this for the year ending March of this year.",POSITIVE,0.5320699
214,We are not yet commenting in terms of quantitative guidance for next year.,POSITIVE,0.9443431
215,"What is clear nonetheless is the demand environment remains strong and our portfolio of services and capabilities, especially on cloud and digital are resonating well with clients so we see a good pipeline for that.",NEGATIVE,0.94330853
216,Our large deals in this quarter also very strong.,NEGATIVE,0.9505245
217,We continue to see a good large deal pipeline.,NEGATIVE,0.88766223
218,"We have seen a steady expansion of our clients over $50, $100, $200 mn and so on.",NEGATIVE,0.9426441
219,We have seen that expansion within clients is working very well and also our new client wins and new accounts are working well.,NEGATIVE,0.9485091
220,"So overall we have the various elements of continuing this demand environment strongly but we do not have a specific guidance yet for year starting in April 1, 2022.",POSITIVE,0.88270724
221,Sandeep Shah Fair enough and just last two bookkeeping questions.,POSITIVE,0.91008824
222,The way I look at is Daimler deal has two legs to ramp up one being the rebadging and employee related ramp up and second being the pass-through data center related ramp up.,POSITIVE,0.84404373
223,"Is it fair to say that most of these two legs ramp up is largely behind or may continue in Q4 as well as 1Q of next financial year and second in terms of FY2022 wage hike, is it largely over or something is due in the fourth quarter as well?",POSITIVE,0.50756633
224,"Salil Parekh On the Daimler, we do not have any more specifics.",POSITIVE,0.9373579
225,"I can understand what you are looking for, but we have not gone into that specifics now with Q3 and Q4.",POSITIVE,0.92643464
226,The overall guidance for increase of the revenue covers all of that including Daimler and many other clients and especially with Q4 and the seasonality of that quarter.,POSITIVE,0.7825416
227,"In terms of salary and compensation increases, we have done three of them for this year.",NEGATIVE,0.7564191
228,There is nothing specific that is planned for Q4.,POSITIVE,0.9393105
229,We will start to look at what we will do in the next financial year but nothing specific is being planned in Q4.,POSITIVE,0.93094206
230,"Sandeep Shah Thanks, and all the best Sir.",POSITIVE,0.63843316
231,Manik Taneja Thank you for the opportunity.,NEGATIVE,0.7128866
232,Just wanted to understand we have seen a significant increase in offshore mix of revenues over the last 18 months and this quarter saw a slight aberration.,NEGATIVE,0.88271075
233,What caused that and how do you see this going forward?,POSITIVE,0.9177225
234,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
235,Salil Parekh The mix has changed over the last 18 months with a lot of the remote working that was put in place and work from home allowing the work to be delivered from a different location with tremendous yields and efficiency.,POSITIVE,0.5307522
236,"What we saw in the last quarter was, some things have opened up in terms of travel and we are also being extremely optimal in what we have done in the previous quarters and this is something that has given us more ability to drive connects with clients and growth.",NEGATIVE,0.9098119
237,"We see in the medium-term, tremendous opportunity for an efficient mix because clients have also seen that once the work is done remotely or work from home that more opportunity exists, there are work to be done from a location further away.",NEGATIVE,0.8046888
238,"So, in general as a medium-term trend we see that as a positive trend, we will have of course each quarter some movements up and down but as a longer- term trend we see that as a positive trend.",POSITIVE,0.5821061
239,Manik Taneja Thank you Salil.,POSITIVE,0.85309523
240,I had one more additional question.,POSITIVE,0.89056677
241,"Just wanted to get your thoughts around what we are seeing from a revenue productivity metrics standpoint, for revenue per person standpoint and while there is significant amount of offshore shift over the last 18 months, we have seen utilization go up.",NEGATIVE,0.9551022
242,"So, what is causing the increase in revenue productivity despite a significant offshore shift that we have seen over the last 18 months.",NEGATIVE,0.8708008
243,If you could talk about some of the factors that are driving it?,POSITIVE,0.9324051
244,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
245,Salil Parekh On the revenue productivity there are a number of things that are going on.,POSITIVE,0.6837648
246,We see some of the mix of our work which is also changing more to digital and there we see much more revenue productivity coming in.,NEGATIVE,0.8084941
247,As you pointed out utilization has also gone up.,NEGATIVE,0.7099833
248,"We will also see some of our work, for example on the consulting side, data and analytics side growing well and that is giving us some level of boost.",NEGATIVE,0.94134736
249,There is also some impact which we have not quantified externally on leveraging some amount of automation and platforms that gives us this benefit.,POSITIVE,0.7621636
250,"So, there are several factors at work despite the onshore offshore mix changes.",POSITIVE,0.8292596
251,"Manik Taneja Sure, thank you and all the best for future.",NEGATIVE,0.7252862
252,Rahul Jain Thanks for the opportunity and congratulations.,POSITIVE,0.76786906
253,"I have a question regarding the core revenue which has seen stabilization this year, I think you have addressed this point partly but wanted to understand what could be the prospect for this side of the revenue in the coming years especially when we talk about so much shift to digitalization?",POSITIVE,0.66957724
254,"Salil Parekh There we have no individual guidance for digital or for the core in that sense, even for Q4 or for the next financial year.",POSITIVE,0.9409198
255,"But structurally what is clear is we have been successful in driving automation and modernization while we make sure that we are probably the most competitive large player in the market, working with large clients.",NEGATIVE,0.875293
256,"This certainly enhances the strong confidence and if we can continue to execute on that, it will have its own benefits in the medium term.",NEGATIVE,0.93680173
257,"Rahul Jain One more thing on the taxation part our tax rate you know steadily has been upwards of 27% on an average, this looks little higher given the country where most of our earnings belongs to so any flavor you can share in terms of what should be the ideal tax rate on a sustainable basis and in near-term?",POSITIVE,0.84066325
258,"Nilanjan Roy Our tax rate has always hovered around this 27%, 28% range and I do not think you will see much movement going against the range.",POSITIVE,0.7650119
259,"Because in any case, as you know, this is India rate plus other countries.",POSITIVE,0.929688
260,25% is India-only rate.,POSITIVE,0.94151103
261,"So I think, in the long run, you will be around this range itself.",POSITIVE,0.7272432
262,Rahul Jain So which regions tax rate are much higher than the 25% rate also for taking this number higher than the average?,POSITIVE,0.8331971
263,"Nilanjan Roy Yes, so see we cannot give that individually, but there are some jurisdictions and also in some jurisdiction where those taxes cannot be set off here as well, so it is a combination of both.",POSITIVE,0.93341124
264,Rahul Jain Okay so if we are not able to set that off those results in double taxation.,NEUTRAL,0.636288
265,That is also a reason okay got it thank you so much.,NEGATIVE,0.59420466
266,James Friedman Let me echo the congratulations for this fiscal year.,POSITIVE,0.8920716
267,"I just had one simple question across for Nilanjan, can you remind us what the capital allocation strategy is.",POSITIVE,0.92310154
268,I remember you had put it out during the analyst day in November 2020 but where is share repurchase in the prioritization.,POSITIVE,0.94445735
269,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
270,"Nilanjan Roy What we had announced in FY20 basically, was that we have taken capital allocation to 85%, prior to this it was 70% and we said that we will take that over the period of 5 years through a combination of progressive growth-oriented dividend policy plus either share buyback or one off special dividends.",POSITIVE,0.6372026
271,"And in the first two years, as we have announced, we have actually paid back 82% through higher increased normal dividends and also through share buyback which we announced last year.",NEGATIVE,0.8903317
272,We have already paid back 82% and we remain quite committed to overall 85% over 5 years.,NEGATIVE,0.8781308
273,James Friedman Got it.,POSITIVE,0.91910106
274,Thank you so much.,POSITIVE,0.58288467
275,Vimal Gohil Thank you for the opportunity and congratulations on a great quarter.,NEGATIVE,0.8908871
276,My question is on your employee cost which partially has been addressed but how should we think about the core employee cost growth which comes under the cost of revenue which has seen around 4% CQGR increase over Q1 of FY2021 versus the 6% revenue growth and this has been in light of a very sharp increase in attrition and of course further supply challenges and etc.,NEGATIVE,0.43472555
277,"So, if you can just highlight, are our wage hikes in line with the industry or have they been much higher than the industry?",POSITIVE,0.7108465
278,How should we think about this historically and if you could give some kind of an outlook over there as well?,POSITIVE,0.91141105
279,Thanks.,POSITIVE,0.8105389
280,"Nilanjan Roy Yes, so you have to see both employee cost and subcon together as the cost of people as a combination, you cannot see one in isolation that is number one.",POSITIVE,0.88102174
281,"Number two, just from an overall cost perspective, we of course are very focused on the attrition and being competitive in the markets as well as being employer of choice for many of our employee.",POSITIVE,0.5261152
282,"Going ahead when we look at intervention on the compensation side like Salil said, we did across, in January, we did across the board, in July we have done across the board, in Q3 as well we have done very segmented and for targeted talent and we will continue doing that into Q4 etc., looking at high points of attrition and doing it much more tactically to see where we are seeing demand being high in the markets for those skills and target those employees really.",POSITIVE,0.55737275
283,"So, I think it is very nuanced like I said and we will continue doing that.",POSITIVE,0.84668165
284,"Vimal Gohil Sir, so basically if we were to look at your guidance, it implies 0% to 2% sort of a revenue growth in Q4.",NEGATIVE,0.80557275
285,"Considering the fact that there were some furloughs in Q3, your revenue growth could be higher than what you have reported in Q3.",NEGATIVE,0.9553073
286,"So, is your guidance conservative at this point in time how should we think about that?",POSITIVE,0.91384953
287,"Salil Parekh In terms of the guidance, it was very strong.",NEGATIVE,0.9088564
288,It is 19.5% to 20%.,POSITIVE,0.89253026
289,"There is no further color in saying whether it is conservative, aggressive, or stable.",POSITIVE,0.935519
290,We see a very good demand outlook; we see good large deals and good portfolio and the guidance is a very big move up from where we were in the last quarter.,NEGATIVE,0.95188725
291,Vimal Gohil – Union AMC Fair enough Sir.,POSITIVE,0.6359884
292,Thank you so much and all the very best.,NEGATIVE,0.6435338
293,Sandeep Mahindroo Thanks Salil for closing comments and thanks again for joining us on this call.,NEGATIVE,0.7566222
294,Look forward to talking to you again during the year.,POSITIVE,0.7864956
295,Thank you.,POSITIVE,0.8234813
