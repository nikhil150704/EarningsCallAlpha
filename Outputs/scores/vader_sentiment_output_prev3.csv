311,"Because it sounds like the problem is much more significant in India versus other markets does this, you think, suggest a broadening of your reach in terms of supply capabilities, in Eastern Europe or otherwise?",0.069,0.787,0.145,0.2484
312,Does it suggest a different strategy on managing your headcount?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
313,Pravin Rao There are a couple of things.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
314,"One is, of course, in terms of talent availability, in terms of scale and quantity I do not think any other country can match that.",0.0,0.896,0.104,0.4215
315,"So, from that extent, most of the noise and other things you are hearing are in India only.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
316,"So that is one part of it, because I do not see any other country being able to provide such kind of talent with scale.",0.0,0.905,0.095,0.3626
317,So that is why we are seeing higher number.,0.0,0.86,0.14,0.0772
318,"And the second one is, this is an unusual phenomenon.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
319,"We have not seen this kind of war for talent for a long period of time and as I myself have been in the industry for over 35 years, I cannot think of a time when we have seen this kind of situation.",0.087,0.854,0.058,-0.3384
320,"When we talk to people them when they are leaving, most of them are complimentary about Infosys, they talk highly about the culture, the kind of training, kind of opportunities they get and other things.",0.0,0.864,0.136,0.6378
321,"But they are also saying, at the same time, the kind of compensation they are being offered is significantly higher.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
322,"So today, despite all the HR interventions and other things, compensation seems to be a very big criteria and particularly for some of the companies who are just scaling up or who are setting up centers here, there are no options but to go aggressive on compensation to attract and get the talent.",0.049,0.833,0.118,0.7227
323,"So, I would say that is the reason.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
324,"And this is an unusual thing where some of your normal HR levers do not seem to work and people do acknowledge that they are happy otherwise, but the kind of offers they are getting is too attractive for them to refuse.",0.058,0.812,0.129,0.5267
325,"These are all junior people, they are not emotionally fully connected with the company, whereas at the mid-level and senior-level, they are much more connected with the company.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
326,"They understand the culture, they understand the industry and other things.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
327,"So there, some of the HR practices work better.",0.0,0.734,0.266,0.4404
328,"But at the junior level, while we try, what is out there is attractive and that becomes a challenge.",0.0,0.762,0.238,0.6486
329,Keith Bachman You mentioned a number of times that you do not see attrition improving over the next couple of quarters.,0.103,0.84,0.057,-0.2575
330,But does your reported number get worse over the next couple of quarters just so we can manage investor expectations?,0.176,0.763,0.061,-0.5719
331,"Pravin Rao It will probably take a couple of quarters before attrition easing, because you have to onboard supply, you have to skill them, train them.",0.0,0.926,0.074,0.25
332,So that will take some time before supply is available to be deployed in projects.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
333,So that is the time that will take before attrition eases.,0.0,0.813,0.187,0.3182
334,That is what I meant.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
335,"Keith Bachman Does your reported attrition number get worse in, than the December and March quarters?",0.168,0.761,0.071,-0.4215

337,"Pravin Rao We hope that is not the case, but it is difficult to predict.",0.179,0.714,0.107,-0.3182

341,"Kawaljeet Saluja Pravin, I have learnt a lot from you and let us hope you stay in touch.",0.0,0.854,0.146,0.4404
342,"I have a couple of questions, one for Pravin and one for Nilanjan.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
343,"Nilanjan, for you the question is that you mentioned that the impact of wage increase is approximately 110 basis points and if I just do the back of the envelope math, your offshore wages, that percentage of revenue is 20%.",0.0,0.944,0.056,0.3182
344,So that equates to just a 5% wage increase effectively.,0.0,0.606,0.394,0.6369
345,Is that sufficient in the current environment?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
346,"Nilanjan Roy Couple of things, one is, of course, there were onsite and offshore both.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
347,There is a mix of that and it is only up to JL6’s.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
348,"So, we planned for the senior and title holders in October.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
349,"Also from October, we are rolling out more skill-based intervention compensation changes.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
350,"So, as you know, this is something we did in January, then we have done something in July.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
351,"And like I said, we are going to do something in October as well, not at the same level, but like I said, we need to do whatever is required to a) keep key talent back, and b) hire laterals as well, because as Pravin mentioned, even the cost of lateral goes up.",0.0,0.788,0.212,0.8979
352,I mean the churn is rotational in the industry.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
353,It is a zero-sum game; somebody else’s lateral is somebody else’s churn.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
354,"So, we will do whatever is required to even onboard lateral and freshers.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
355,"But at the end of the day, I think from an industry perspective, it is only once the freshers come in, can you really start seeing this thing really easing up.",0.0,0.911,0.089,0.4478
356,"But we are quite comfortable in that sense in terms of our guidance, in terms of fulfilling what the clients are asking for and one of the ways is, of course, the subcon increase is not the best from a margin perspective, but you have seen our stats on subcon slightly going up just to fulfill that gap.",0.065,0.769,0.166,0.7985
357,"Kawaljeet Saluja What will be the impact of wage revision, let us say, in December because that would be rolled out at a senior level?",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
358,"So, the impact of that would be a higher percentage offshore overall compensation number.",0.0,0.909,0.091,0.0772
359,"So, what will be the impact of wage revision in December?",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
360,"Nilanjan Roy So, we do not call out, but the overall wage impact of the senior level is definitely lower than I mean the headcount is a much, much smaller amount than what we have rolled out.",0.068,0.846,0.086,0.1901
361,But we cannot give a number of what is the margin impact.,0.108,0.892,0.0,-0.0857
362,Kawaljeet Saluja The second question I had is for Pravin.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
363,"Now, Pravin, we have been wired through your performance historically that whenever the attrition rates go up, your utilization rates go down.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
364,"But this time around, they seem to be moving in the same direction, which is rather unusual.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
365,"When do you think that this divergence really starts playing out the way, logically, it has done historically?",0.0,0.891,0.109,0.2682
366,"Pravin Rao I am not sure about the correlation you are talking about because if attrition goes up the natural correlation would be utilization also improving, so there is a need to fulfillment, right?",0.051,0.81,0.139,0.5168
367,"I mean you are talking about contrary, so I am not sure of the application.",0.123,0.877,0.0,-0.2411
368,Kawaljeet Saluja But the logic is straightforward.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
369,"Ultimately if the attrition is higher, normally you require greater project bench to fulfill customer demand and a high attrition environment also indicates a healthy growth environment, again which need a larger bench.",0.037,0.697,0.266,0.8481
370,So that was the logic behind that statement.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
371,"Pravin Rao But anyway, in the current situation, there is no supply.",0.203,0.797,0.0,-0.4215
372,"As I said, you have to recruit people, train them and then deploy, that will take some time.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
373,"You have to look at your existing people, re-skill them and deploy, that is the fastest thing for you to do.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
374,"That means higher utilization and wherever there are gaps, we also look at subcons and we have seen increased subcons as well.",0.0,0.826,0.174,0.4939
375,"So, the high utilization is definitely a function of lack of availability of talent, and we are recruiting as much as we can to meet the demands of our customers.",0.066,0.776,0.158,0.4939
376,"Kawaljeet Saluja Okay, fantastic.",0.0,0.267,0.733,0.6705

379,"Two questions, the first question is to Nilanjan on margins.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
380,We just wanted to understand the puts and takes on margins in the second half.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
381,"When we look at the various headwinds, there are continued rising attrition rates, higher travel expenses potentially; wage hike for a section of employees, full impact of the large deal ramp up, which is likely to take place in 3Q as well.",0.0,0.951,0.049,0.2732
382,So just trying to understand what are the tailwinds that can help to offset some of these impacts and keep the margin within the bag?,0.0,0.899,0.101,0.4019
383,"Nilanjan Roy We are going to have these headwinds, like you said on retention, on hiring, etc.",0.0,0.865,0.135,0.3612
384,"But I think, like we demonstrated this quarter as well, we have a very strong cost optimization program also ongoing, automation, onsite offshore mix with broad basing of the pyramid, both onsite offshore.",0.0,0.665,0.335,0.9391
385,"We are among the few companies who have these global DCs now in the West, where we can pump in freshers, right.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
386,"So, I mean, we would not have had freshers in our onsite business, but now we are having more than 3,000-odd freshers a year in the onsite locations.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
387,"So, this also helps in the pyramid.",0.0,0.698,0.302,0.3818
388,"And as you know, 75% of our people cost is onsite.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
389,"So, unless we really address onsite costs, you cannot really make an impact on the overall cost structure.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
390,"So, all this is going on.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
391,"We are also looking at pricing much more holistically at this time, although it is not easy to go and get price hikes just on the basis of a rate card.",0.074,0.926,0.0,-0.3412
392,"But basically, we are working with our sales force on how to sell on value, how to sell on more innovative commercial constructs and the idea is not to leave those cents and pennies on the table in this market, be a bit bolder in terms of pricing.",0.0,0.794,0.206,0.8863
393,"But this is a long haul, if there is any time to start something on this, it is now.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
394,Gaurav Rateria My second question is to Salil with respect to visibility.,0.0,0.78,0.22,0.4767
395,"As we enter calendar 2022, is it fair to say that when we entered calendar 2021, the visibility was higher than usual, given the large amount of the new deals already in the bag, which may not necessarily be the case as we get into the calendar 2022?",0.0,0.953,0.047,0.3182

401,We have now further increased the guidance this quarter.,0.0,0.792,0.208,0.2732
