664,You did make the comment that you,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
665,"think attrition improves next year, and I do not disagree with you, but I wanted to understand your",0.0,0.821,0.179,0.3595
666,"thinking and more specifically, is it because demand slows across the industry?",0.12,0.88,0.0,-0.128

668,"referenced, it is an industry issue.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
669,And that allows attrition to improve or there is some something,0.0,0.775,0.225,0.4404
670,"fundamentally that you think demand can stay at these levels or maybe moderate a touch, but you",0.072,0.928,0.0,-0.0644
671,can continue to hire more freshers to meet that.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

683,"In the near future, we are not seeing demand coming down by any accounts.",0.0,0.905,0.095,0.0951
684,But,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
685,today there is a shortage of talent and particularly in some of the geographies because of travel,0.101,0.758,0.141,0.2023

707,Pravin Rao,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
708,There are a couple of things.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
709,"One is, of course, in terms of talent availability, in terms of scale and",0.0,0.823,0.177,0.4215

711,"So, from that extent, most of the noise",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
712,and other things you are hearing are in India only.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
713,"So that is one part of it, because I do not see",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
714,any other country being able to provide such kind of talent with scale.,0.0,0.827,0.173,0.3626

717,"And the second one is, this is an unusual phenomenon.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
718,We have not seen this,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
719,kind of war for talent for a long period of time and as I myself have been in the industry for over 35,0.141,0.758,0.101,-0.2732

725,"saying, at the same time, the kind of compensation they are being offered is significantly higher.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

734,"These are all junior people, they",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

771,one for Pravin and one for Nilanjan.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
772,"Nilanjan, for you the question is that you mentioned that the",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
773,impact of wage increase is approximately 110 basis points and if I just do the back of the envelope,0.0,0.887,0.113,0.3182
774,"math, your offshore wages, that percentage of revenue is 20%.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

786,"something we did in January, then we have done something in July.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
787,"And like I said, we are going",0.0,0.706,0.294,0.3612
788,"to do something in October as well, not at the same level, but like I said, we need to do whatever",0.0,0.798,0.202,0.5859
789,"is required to a) keep key talent back, and b) hire laterals as well, because as Pravin mentioned,",0.0,0.766,0.234,0.5994
790,even the cost of lateral goes up.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
791,I mean the churn is rotational in the industry.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
792,It is a zero-sum,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

795,even onboard lateral and freshers.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
796,"But at the end of the day, I think from an industry perspective, it",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
797,"is only once the freshers come in, can you really start seeing this thing really easing up.",0.0,0.875,0.125,0.3167
798,But we,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
799,"are quite comfortable in that sense in terms of our guidance, in terms of fulfilling what the clients",0.0,0.826,0.174,0.5563

813,Kawaljeet Saluja,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
814,The second question I had is for Pravin.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
815,"Now, Pravin, we have been wired through your",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
816,"performance historically that whenever the attrition rates go up, your utilization rates go down.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

819,When do,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

821,Pravin Rao,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
822,I am not sure about the correlation you are talking about because if attrition goes up the natural,0.096,0.782,0.122,0.1376
823,"correlation would be utilization also improving, so there is a need to fulfillment, right?",0.0,0.823,0.177,0.4215
824,I mean you,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
825,"are talking about contrary, so I am not sure of the application.",0.151,0.849,0.0,-0.2411
826,Kawaljeet Saluja,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
827,But the logic is straightforward.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
828,"Ultimately if the attrition is higher, normally you require greater",0.0,0.783,0.217,0.3612
829,project bench to fulfill customer demand and a high attrition environment also indicates a healthy,0.079,0.628,0.293,0.6249
830,"growth environment, again which need a larger bench.",0.0,0.729,0.271,0.3818

832,statement.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
833,Pravin Rao,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
834,"But anyway, in the current situation, there is no supply.",0.237,0.763,0.0,-0.4215

837,"You have to look at your existing people, re-skill",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
838,"them and deploy, that is the fastest thing for you to do.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
839,That means higher utilization and wherever,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
840,"there are gaps, we also look at subcons and we have seen increased subcons as well.",0.0,0.769,0.231,0.4939
