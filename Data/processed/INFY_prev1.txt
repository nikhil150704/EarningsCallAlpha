INFY_Q3_january_22_35 | sequential growth and 21.5% YoY growth in constant currency terms.
INFY_Q3_january_22_36 | Our YoY growth
INFY_Q3_january_22_37 | was the fastest we have had in 11 years.
INFY_Q3_january_22_38 | The growth was broad-based across industries, service lines and geographies driven by
INFY_Q3_january_22_39 | our differentiated digital and cloud capabilities.
INFY_Q3_january_22_40 | A strong broad-based growth in a
INFY_Q3_january_22_41 | seasonally weak quarter is a clear testament to the enormous confidence clients have in
INFY_Q3_january_22_42 | us to help them accelerate their business transformation.

INFY_Q3_january_22_46 | efforts in delivering success for our clients.

INFY_Q3_january_22_87 | Retail segment growth was 19.8% in constant currency.
INFY_Q3_january_22_88 | Across sub-verticals we see

INFY_Q3_january_22_90 | omnichannel commerce and large-scale cost take out initiatives to improve business
INFY_Q3_january_22_91 | resilience.

INFY_Q3_january_22_93 | The communication segment grew at 22.2% on constant currency.
INFY_Q3_january_22_94 | Segment performance
INFY_Q3_january_22_95 | continued to improve with ramp up of recently won deals.

INFY_Q3_january_22_99 | Energy, utility, resources and services vertical continued its steady performance with
INFY_Q3_january_22_100 | 13.6% constant currency growth and 5 large deal wins.
INFY_Q3_january_22_101 | We are seeing gradual
INFY_Q3_january_22_102 | improvement across various businesses as consumer spending continues to increase and
INFY_Q3_january_22_103 | clients focus on increasing technology transformation around areas like customer
INFY_Q3_january_22_104 | experience, cybersecurity and workload migration to the cloud.

INFY_Q3_january_22_115 | Life Sciences segment performance also improved further to 29.2% growth.
INFY_Q3_january_22_116 | Adoption of

INFY_Q3_january_22_127 | modules that will be developed.

INFY_Q3_january_22_129 | capabilities from Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Cloud Services, IoT, Engineering,
INFY_Q3_january_22_130 | Modernization and Big Data and Analytics.
INFY_Q3_january_22_131 | The strong overall performance stems from four years of sustained strategic focus in
INFY_Q3_january_22_132 | areas of relevance for our clients in digital and cloud, continuing reskilling of our people
INFY_Q3_january_22_133 | and deep relationships of trust our clients have with us.
INFY_Q3_january_22_134 | With this strong momentum in the business and robust pipeline we are increasing our
INFY_Q3_january_22_135 | annual revenue growth guidance from 16.5% to 17.5% moving up to 19.5% to 20% in
INFY_Q3_january_22_136 | constant currency.
INFY_Q3_january_22_137 | Our operating margin guidance remains at 22% to 24%.
INFY_Q3_january_22_138 | With that, let me hand it over to Nilanjan for his update.
INFY_Q3_january_22_139 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q3_january_22_140 | everyone a very happy and safe 2022.
INFY_Q3_january_22_141 | Q3 was another successive quarter of continued acceleration in revenues at 7.0%
INFY_Q3_january_22_142 | constant currency QoQ growth and 21.5% constant currency YoY growth, the highest YoY
INFY_Q3_january_22_143 | growth in the last 11 years.
INFY_Q3_january_22_144 | Despite the Q3 seasonality, we registered strong broad-based growth across geographies
INFY_Q3_january_22_145 | and verticals.
INFY_Q3_january_22_146 | Our largest geography North America grew at 21.4% while growth in Europe
INFY_Q3_january_22_147 | accelerated to an impressive 27.2% YoY in constant currency terms.
INFY_Q3_january_22_148 | Retail,
INFY_Q3_january_22_149 | Communication, Manufacturing and Life Sciences also saw 20% or higher YoY growth in
INFY_Q3_january_22_150 | constant currency.
INFY_Q3_january_22_151 | We won 25 large deals, and large deals being those with over $50 mn TCV, totaling $2.5
INFY_Q3_january_22_152 | bn of TCV - 6 in Retail, 5 each in Financial Services, Communications, and Energy Utilities

INFY_Q3_january_22_155 | The share
INFY_Q3_january_22_156 | of new deals increased in Q3 to 44% within the large deal numbers.
INFY_Q3_january_22_157 | Client metrics improved further with $100+ mn client count increasing to 37, an increase of
INFY_Q3_january_22_158 | 8 YoY.
INFY_Q3_january_22_159 | We added 111 new clients in the last quarter.
INFY_Q3_january_22_160 | Operating parameters remain robust.
INFY_Q3_january_22_161 | Utilization was 88.5% slightly lower than the
INFY_Q3_january_22_162 | previous quarter easing some of the supply side pressures.
INFY_Q3_january_22_163 | Onsite effort mix inched up
INFY_Q3_january_22_164 | marginally to 23.8%.
INFY_Q3_january_22_165 | Q3 margins remained resilient at 23.5%, a marginal drop of 10 basis points versus
INFY_Q3_january_22_166 | previous quarter.
INFY_Q3_january_22_167 | The major components of the sequential margin movements were as
INFY_Q3_january_22_168 | below.
INFY_Q3_january_22_169 | • 80 basis points impact due to comp hikes and promotions and other employee
INFY_Q3_january_22_170 | interventions.
INFY_Q3_january_22_171 | • 40 basis points impact due to the utilization decline.
INFY_Q3_january_22_172 | These were offset by
INFY_Q3_january_22_173 | • About 20 basis points benefit due to the rupee and other cross currency
INFY_Q3_january_22_174 | movements,
INFY_Q3_january_22_175 | • 50 basis point benefit due to cost optimization, and
INFY_Q3_january_22_176 | • 40 basis points benefit due to SG&A leverage other one-offs included therein.
INFY_Q3_january_22_177 | Q3 EPS grew by 11.2% in dollar terms and 13.1% in rupee terms on a YoY basis.
INFY_Q3_january_22_178 | Although DSO increased to 71 days due to higher seasonal billing, an increase of 5 days
INFY_Q3_january_22_179 | versus the last quarter, it is still a reduction of 2 days versus Q3 of prior year.
INFY_Q3_january_22_180 | Free cash flow for the quarter was healthy at $719 mn.
INFY_Q3_january_22_181 | Free cash flow as a percentage of
INFY_Q3_january_22_182 | net profit was 93% for Q3 and 104% for the nine months till date.
INFY_Q3_january_22_183 | Yield on cash balances improved to 5.29% compared to 5.13% in Q2.
INFY_Q3_january_22_184 | Our balance sheet remains strong and debt free.
INFY_Q3_january_22_185 | Consolidated cash and investments at
INFY_Q3_january_22_186 | the end of the quarter stood at $4.28 bn after paying over $840 mn of interim dividend
INFY_Q3_january_22_187 | during the quarter.
INFY_Q3_january_22_188 | Return on equity increased further to 30.4% an increase of 3% over Q3 of the prior year
INFY_Q3_january_22_189 | driven by robust performance and consistent capital returns through share buyback and
INFY_Q3_january_22_190 | increased dividend payout.
INFY_Q3_january_22_191 | On the employee front, voluntary 12 months attrition increased to 25.5% and as Salil
INFY_Q3_january_22_192 | commented while LTM attrition continues to increase due to the tail effect, quarterly
INFY_Q3_january_22_193 | annualized attrition was flattish compared to Q2.
INFY_Q3_january_22_194 | We will continue to invest in all aspects of
INFY_Q3_january_22_195 | talent retention including compensation, promotion, skill incentives, learning and career
INFY_Q3_january_22_196 | progression.
INFY_Q3_january_22_197 | We have also simultaneously increased the pace of hiring, talent reskilling and the usage
INFY_Q3_january_22_198 | of subcon to prevent any impact on client commitment.
INFY_Q3_january_22_199 | We have added 12,450 talented
INFY_Q3_january_22_200 | employees on a net basis in the last quarter, which is the highest ever.
INFY_Q3_january_22_201 | Our global college
INFY_Q3_january_22_202 | graduate hiring program for this fiscal has been increased to over 55,000 versus the
INFY_Q3_january_22_203 | previous quarter number of 45,000.
INFY_Q3_january_22_204 | In India over 93% of Infoscions have received at least one dose of the vaccine.
INFY_Q3_january_22_205 | Over 97%
INFY_Q3_january_22_206 | of our employees globally are presently working in remote environment, due to the
INFY_Q3_january_22_207 | heightened precautions against the new variant.
INFY_Q3_january_22_208 | Driven by robust demand environment and our continued market share gains, we are
INFY_Q3_january_22_209 | further increasing our revenue guidance for FY22 to 19.5% to 20% in constant currency
INFY_Q3_january_22_210 | terms from 16.5% to 17.5% earlier and the margin guidance remains unchanged at 22%
INFY_Q3_january_22_211 | to 24%.
INFY_Q3_january_22_212 | With that we can open the call for questions.
INFY_Q3_january_22_213 | Moderator
INFY_Q3_january_22_214 | Thank you very much.
INFY_Q3_january_22_215 | We will now begin the question-and-answer session.
INFY_Q3_january_22_216 | The first
INFY_Q3_january_22_217 | question is from the line of Ankur Rudra from JP Morgan.
INFY_Q3_january_22_218 | Please go ahead.
INFY_Q3_january_22_219 | Ankur Rudra
INFY_Q3_january_22_220 | Thank you.
INFY_Q3_january_22_221 | Happy New Year to everybody.
INFY_Q3_january_22_222 | Excellent numbers for the quarter.
INFY_Q3_january_22_223 | Clearly a
INFY_Q3_january_22_224 | very strong growth for Q3.
INFY_Q3_january_22_225 | Could you start with elaborating on –where did the incremental
INFY_Q3_january_22_226 | surprise come from.
INFY_Q3_january_22_227 | The full year guidance has increased sharply given the performance
INFY_Q3_january_22_228 | of the quarter, so where did the surprise come from?
INFY_Q3_january_22_229 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q3_january_22_230 | I think what we are seeing in the quarter and then all through the year, is the demand
INFY_Q3_january_22_231 | environment remains extremely strong and then more and more traction on the digital and
INFY_Q3_january_22_232 | the cloud programs.
INFY_Q3_january_22_233 | This is where we saw the most impact in the quarter in Q3 where we
INFY_Q3_january_22_234 | had really strong growth of 7% and therefore the overall guidance jumping up by 3%.
INFY_Q3_january_22_235 | In terms of verticals, as I was sharing earlier, it is broad based.
INFY_Q3_january_22_236 | Of course, we have a very
INFY_Q3_january_22_237 | strong momentum in Manufacturing, that was something that we were looking forward to.
INFY_Q3_january_22_238 | There is also good momentum that we are seeing in Financial Services given it is our
INFY_Q3_january_22_239 | largest vertical, and in Life Sciences that I described before.
INFY_Q3_january_22_240 | Retail is starting to come
INFY_Q3_january_22_241 | back nicely as well.
INFY_Q3_january_22_242 | As Nilanjan mentioned, Europe again was a stand-out.
INFY_Q3_january_22_243 | Those are
INFY_Q3_january_22_244 | some of the elements that gave us a good outcome in Q3 and then the support for
INFY_Q3_january_22_245 | expanding the guidance for the full year.
INFY_Q3_january_22_246 | Moderator
INFY_Q3_january_22_247 | ahead.
INFY_Q3_january_22_248 | Moshe Katri
INFY_Q3_january_22_249 | Thanks.
INFY_Q3_january_22_250 | Happy New Year and congrats on very strong results.
INFY_Q3_january_22_251 | One, I know you just
INFY_Q3_january_22_252 | reported Q3 but are you ready to talk about the entire calendar year down the road, 2022.
INFY_Q3_january_22_253 | What has changed in terms of visibility, may be that is the biggest question if this is
INFY_Q3_january_22_254 | sustainable down the road.
INFY_Q3_january_22_255 | And what can you talk about in terms of color to give us that
INFY_Q3_january_22_256 | comfort.
INFY_Q3_january_22_257 | And then maybe you can talk a bit about some of the cushion in margins and
INFY_Q3_january_22_258 | what sort of levers that you have in the model, especially as some of the bench continues
INFY_Q3_january_22_259 | to benefit from the off campus recruiting that has been pretty robust?
INFY_Q3_january_22_260 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q3_january_22_261 | I will start off with the first part and then Nilanjan will comment on the margin levers.
INFY_Q3_january_22_262 | Of
INFY_Q3_january_22_263 | course, as you referenced, we have guidance till March 31 of this year.
INFY_Q3_january_22_264 | The color for this
INFY_Q3_january_22_265 | calendar year, broadly we see the demand environment remaining strong, the client
INFY_Q3_january_22_266 | budgets are looking good.
INFY_Q3_january_22_267 | Our overall pipeline is the largest we have had in a very long
INFY_Q3_january_22_268 | time, the number of large deals that we were able to close, as Nilanjan shared- 25 large
INFY_Q3_january_22_269 | deals each over $50 mn for a total of $2.5 bn and 44% of these are net new.
INFY_Q3_january_22_270 | So, all of
INFY_Q3_january_22_271 | those things are giving us good confidence to what we see going ahead.
INFY_Q3_january_22_272 | Of course, we
INFY_Q3_january_22_273 | will have our guidance for our financial year in April.
INFY_Q3_january_22_274 | Nilanjan over to you please.
INFY_Q3_january_22_275 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q3_january_22_276 | Moshe, on the margins, like I mentioned earlier they were quite resilient for the quarter.
INFY_Q3_january_22_277 | A
INFY_Q3_january_22_278 | couple of things I just want to call out – the cost levers whether it is onsite or offshore mix,
INFY_Q3_january_22_279 | the pyramid, whether it is automation – these are some of the things which we
INFY_Q3_january_22_280 | continuously look at deploying.
INFY_Q3_january_22_281 | Subcon costs for us have really ramped up and that is an
INFY_Q3_january_22_282 | area we will continue to look going ahead.
INFY_Q3_january_22_283 | The other thing is pricing and it is important to
INFY_Q3_january_22_284 | talk about that as the higher cost now starts feeding into our new deals, that should
INFY_Q3_january_22_285 | hopefully have benefits and as digital talents start getting priced in, we are able to show
INFY_Q3_january_22_286 | value to our clients in terms of the business transformation.
INFY_Q3_january_22_287 | This is something we have
INFY_Q3_january_22_288 | started recently.
INFY_Q3_january_22_289 | It will take time to pick up and we have talked about it in the last quarter
INFY_Q3_january_22_290 | as well.
INFY_Q3_january_22_291 | But really that is our focus - we can start getting into both our cost side and also
INFY_Q3_january_22_292 | make sure that we are not leaving any free cents and dollars on the table as part of our
INFY_Q3_january_22_293 | pricing negotiations.
INFY_Q3_january_22_294 | Moderator
INFY_Q3_january_22_295 | go ahead.

INFY_Q3_january_22_297 | Good evening, everyone and thank you for taking my question.
INFY_Q3_january_22_298 | Congratulations on great
INFY_Q3_january_22_299 | set of numbers.
INFY_Q3_january_22_300 | My first question Salil was, going into this calendar year, one of the largest
INFY_Q3_january_22_301 | peers has indicated a strong growth to continue through this year.
INFY_Q3_january_22_302 | So, looking at our
INFY_Q3_january_22_303 | portfolio of capabilities and offerings, do you see that we are well aligned to meet or beat
INFY_Q3_january_22_304 | their growth numbers or do you see that we need some intervention to build up our own
INFY_Q3_january_22_305 | capability to continue this strong growth going ahead?
INFY_Q3_january_22_306 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q3_january_22_307 | Thanks for that question.
INFY_Q3_january_22_308 | I think in terms of our key capabilities set we have a strong
INFY_Q3_january_22_309 | portfolio across digital and cloud.
INFY_Q3_january_22_310 | Our Cobalt set of capabilities is resonating extremely
INFY_Q3_january_22_311 | well with our clients.
INFY_Q3_january_22_312 | We see the growth of digital being a reflection of the focus we have
INFY_Q3_january_22_313 | had on making these choices over the past four years and positioning the portfolio to
INFY_Q3_january_22_314 | where the clients are looking for work.
INFY_Q3_january_22_315 | We also see the cloud capability faster growing
INFY_Q3_january_22_316 | than our digital capability.
INFY_Q3_january_22_317 | So yes, we are well positioned to benefit from this.
INFY_Q3_january_22_318 | In addition to
INFY_Q3_january_22_319 | that, we have a strong set of capabilities in automation, in modernization.
INFY_Q3_january_22_320 | We have even
INFY_Q3_january_22_321 | seen our core services which is now stable this quarter in terms of growth, it is not
INFY_Q3_january_22_322 | shrinking.
INFY_Q3_january_22_323 | Our view is that our set of capabilities and portfolio is reflecting what our client
INFY_Q3_january_22_324 | expectation/demands are and we have the ability to meet all those from the capability
INFY_Q3_january_22_325 | perspective.
INFY_Q3_january_22_326 | We also have the capacity to expand and recruit at the college level and our
INFY_Q3_january_22_327 | ongoing recruiting ability to attract talent, which is helping us to deliver all our projects on a
INFY_Q3_january_22_328 | regular basis.
INFY_Q3_january_22_329 | So, we feel quite good on how we are positioned as we go ahead into the
INFY_Q3_january_22_330 | next year as well.
INFY_Q3_january_22_331 | Kumar Rakesh
INFY_Q3_january_22_332 | 22% to 24%.
INFY_Q3_january_22_333 | Currently we are trending to the upper end so how should we see that?
INFY_Q3_january_22_334 | Is it
INFY_Q3_january_22_335 | that you want to keep flexibility with yourself in anticipation of any large deals or any cost
INFY_Q3_january_22_336 | headwind potentially coming from that or is there an indication that you are looking at
INFY_Q3_january_22_337 | some major cost headwind which are going to come in, in the coming quarter and hence
INFY_Q3_january_22_338 | you are maintaining this margin guidance band?
INFY_Q3_january_22_339 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q3_january_22_340 | The margin guidance for us is really a comfort range within which we operate so we really
INFY_Q3_january_22_341 | do not fine tune that as the year progresses.
INFY_Q3_january_22_342 | So, this is a band which we are happy to be
INFY_Q3_january_22_343 | in.
INFY_Q3_january_22_344 | It was 21% to 23% just before COVID.
INFY_Q3_january_22_345 | Now we are 22% to 24%.
INFY_Q3_january_22_346 | So that is more like a
INFY_Q3_january_22_347 | way for us rather than anything else.
INFY_Q3_january_22_348 | And looking ahead, we continue to focus on our cost
INFY_Q3_january_22_349 | headwinds potentially in terms of employees, etc., it could be travel into the next year, but
INFY_Q3_january_22_350 | like I said we have a very robust cost optimization and of course other levers, which we
INFY_Q3_january_22_351 | continue to deploy, so we are quite confident on this.
INFY_Q3_january_22_352 | Kumar Rakesh
INFY_Q3_january_22_353 | So more of a reflection of flexibility that you want to keep for yourself?
INFY_Q3_january_22_354 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q3_january_22_355 | Correct.
INFY_Q3_january_22_356 | Kumar Rakesh
INFY_Q3_january_22_357 | Thanks a lot for those answers.
INFY_Q3_january_22_358 | I will fall back.

INFY_Q3_january_22_360 | Markets.
INFY_Q3_january_22_361 | Please go ahead.
INFY_Q3_january_22_362 | Keith Bachman
INFY_Q3_january_22_363 | I want to pick up on the same line of questioning, if you could just talk about the puts and
INFY_Q3_january_22_364 | takes as you see margins over the course of the next three, four, five quarters, really
INFY_Q3_january_22_365 | calendar year 2022 and I wanted to see if you could address what you think the impact
INFY_Q3_january_22_366 | would be for a few things.
INFY_Q3_january_22_367 | For instance, one of the headwinds this quarter was utilization,
INFY_Q3_january_22_368 | how should we be thinking about utilization transform during calendar year 2022?
INFY_Q3_january_22_369 | Number
INFY_Q3_january_22_370 | two you said attrition was flat sequentially, how do you think about attrition trends over the
INFY_Q3_january_22_371 | course of calendar year 2022?
INFY_Q3_january_22_372 | Do you think that they can move lower or is the market
INFY_Q3_january_22_373 | such that demand is so strong that attrition will probably remain elevated?
INFY_Q3_january_22_374 | Number three
INFY_Q3_january_22_375 | would be you just brought up travel and any other issues that we should we be thinking
INFY_Q3_january_22_376 | about that may impact calendar year 2022 margins, and any other issues you want to
INFY_Q3_january_22_377 | bring up and that is it from me?
INFY_Q3_january_22_378 | Thank you.
INFY_Q3_january_22_379 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q3_january_22_380 | I think that we do not give up the margin guidance for the next year.
INFY_Q3_january_22_381 | Now having said that
INFY_Q3_january_22_382 | looking at the headwinds, which we actually say pretty much every year are the
INFY_Q3_january_22_383 | compensation hikes, you have clients coming back for discounts on renewals, and some
INFY_Q3_january_22_384 | of that you offset with the cost optimization program which we run, and I mentioned that a
INFY_Q3_january_22_385 | bit earlier in terms of whether it is a pyramid, whether it is subcon, whether it is
INFY_Q3_january_22_386 | automation, new levers which we are looking at is pricing.
INFY_Q3_january_22_387 | So, that is something which we
INFY_Q3_january_22_388 | are continuously working on and remain quite confident.
INFY_Q3_january_22_389 | Travel is one thing which is quite
INFY_Q3_january_22_390 | unknown at this moment in terms of when does it come back, even if it comes back does it
INFY_Q3_january_22_391 | come back to pre COVID levels or in a slightly lower levels so we will have to watch out for
INFY_Q3_january_22_392 | that really.
INFY_Q3_january_22_393 | In terms of attrition, I think it is a larger industry issue.
INFY_Q3_january_22_394 | It is not peculiar to us and
INFY_Q3_january_22_395 | fundamentally the volume increase for this industry has to come from freshers.
INFY_Q3_january_22_396 | Otherwise,
INFY_Q3_january_22_397 | it's a zero-sum game – somebody else's attrition is my lateral and my attrition is somebody
INFY_Q3_january_22_398 | else's lateral.
INFY_Q3_january_22_399 | So as long as the fresher intake starts increasing because first they have to come into
INFY_Q3_january_22_400 | training, then they go into production after 3 or 4 months and that is something which will
INFY_Q3_january_22_401 | help with the attrition in the medium term; and like I said we have seen attrition flattening
INFY_Q3_january_22_402 | sequentially on a quarterly annualized basis and looking ahead we are seeing some
INFY_Q3_january_22_403 | positive signs, but it is too early to say whether it will dramatically come down.
INFY_Q3_january_22_404 | But like I
INFY_Q3_january_22_405 | said, as freshers feed into the system we should see the overall environment in terms of
INFY_Q3_january_22_406 | attrition in the market improving.
INFY_Q3_january_22_407 | Keith Bachman
INFY_Q3_january_22_408 | But any comments specifically on utilization?
INFY_Q3_january_22_409 | You think it will help, I heard it is neutral just
INFY_Q3_january_22_410 | broadly, and as part of that the offshore percent of labor increase YoY, is that also a trend
INFY_Q3_january_22_411 | that you think continues given the dynamics in front of you?
INFY_Q3_january_22_412 | And I will see the floor
INFY_Q3_january_22_413 | thereafter.
INFY_Q3_january_22_414 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q3_january_22_415 | In terms of utilization, this is higher than what we would normally like to be.
INFY_Q3_january_22_416 | We would
INFY_Q3_january_22_417 | rather operate at 85% to 86%, but having said that even if we bring this down in the future
INFY_Q3_january_22_418 | it is largely at offshore locations because 75% of our effort is sitting there.
INFY_Q3_january_22_419 | Therefore,
INFY_Q3_january_22_420 | utilization does not directly link to the margins because of the way the offshore costs
INFY_Q3_january_22_421 | operate, so that is one factor.
INFY_Q3_january_22_422 | The second question, in the long run - if you see, COVID, while it had a huge impact on
INFY_Q3_january_22_423 | demand, the entire ability for the supply side to deliver in a remote environment really will
INFY_Q3_january_22_424 | shine up, and that has opened up the eyes of many of our clients that every work does not
INFY_Q3_january_22_425 | have to be done onsite.
INFY_Q3_january_22_426 | It can be done in a near shore location, it can be done offshore
INFY_Q3_january_22_427 | and I think the beauty of that is secularly we believe this will help the industry in a much
INFY_Q3_january_22_428 | more larger offshoring at an overall level and of course part of that benefit will be shifting
INFY_Q3_january_22_429 | more work to offshore locations.
INFY_Q3_january_22_430 | So, I think this is a good sign.
INFY_Q3_january_22_431 | I think there can be short
INFY_Q3_january_22_432 | term impacts like we saw this quarter, 10 to 20 basis points here and there, but the secular
INFY_Q3_january_22_433 | trend - we think we will continue to see that the large global markets will open a lot more
INFY_Q3_january_22_434 | offshoring opportunities.
INFY_Q3_january_22_435 | Keith Bachman
INFY_Q3_january_22_436 | Many thanks.

INFY_Q3_january_22_440 | Diviya Nagarajan
INFY_Q3_january_22_441 | Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a very impressive quarter to the
INFY_Q3_january_22_442 | team.
INFY_Q3_january_22_443 | My question is on pricing, Salil we have seen now several quarters of strong
INFY_Q3_january_22_444 | demand and it looks like we are looking at another year, looking at the run rate that we are
INFY_Q3_january_22_445 | exiting the calendar with a pretty strong demand as well and you just discussed supply in
INFY_Q3_january_22_446 | the last few comments that you made.
INFY_Q3_january_22_447 | How do you see pricing really trend in the next 12-
INFY_Q3_january_22_448 | 18 months, is there an opportunity for this to go up on a like to like basis?
INFY_Q3_january_22_449 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q3_january_22_450 | Diviya thanks for that question, this is Salil.
INFY_Q3_january_22_451 | I think on pricing first we have seen some level
INFY_Q3_january_22_452 | of stability in what we saw in the specific deals that we closed in Q3 versus Q2.
INFY_Q3_january_22_453 | On the
INFY_Q3_january_22_454 | longer term, Nilanjan has shared in the past we have put in place a very focused effort on
INFY_Q3_january_22_455 | communicating the value that we are helping create with our clients through the digital
INFY_Q3_january_22_456 | programs.
INFY_Q3_january_22_457 | We are also seeing as we have shared wage increases, we have done three in
INFY_Q3_january_22_458 | the last 12 months and broadly we are seeing large enterprises for the first time in a very
INFY_Q3_january_22_459 | long time are seeing inflation in their daily environment and so are more open to having
INFY_Q3_january_22_460 | these discussions.
INFY_Q3_january_22_461 | With these factors in mind, we really see some more value that we can
INFY_Q3_january_22_462 | bring in through communicating and demonstrating our digital impact that we are creating
INFY_Q3_january_22_463 | through those programs.
INFY_Q3_january_22_464 | And that, while it will not be immediate, over the next several
INFY_Q3_january_22_465 | quarters, in my view will help us to build out more resilience in the margin profile.
INFY_Q3_january_22_466 | Diviya Nagarajan – UBS
INFY_Q3_january_22_467 | You earlier enumerated your skills and capabilities, but if you were to kind of think of any
INFY_Q3_january_22_468 | future investments that you are going to make, in which direction would you direct that
INFY_Q3_january_22_469 | investment through in terms of your skills and capabilities?
INFY_Q3_january_22_470 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q3_january_22_471 | Today the biggest drive within our clients is really cloud, our Cobalt capabilities are very
INFY_Q3_january_22_472 | strong and we are constantly enhancing it.
INFY_Q3_january_22_473 | Whether we look at the public cloud
INFY_Q3_january_22_474 | partnerships, we have also a strong ecosystem of private cloud partnerships, we have a
INFY_Q3_january_22_475 | good ecosystem with the SaaS players, extremely strong cloud native cloud first
INFY_Q3_january_22_476 | development.
INFY_Q3_january_22_477 | Those would be really the first areas where we are already leading, but we
INFY_Q3_january_22_478 | will continue to grow.
INFY_Q3_january_22_479 | Then you have the areas which focus on cybersecurity, which focus on data and analytics,
INFY_Q3_january_22_480 | which focus on IoT.
INFY_Q3_january_22_481 | Those are the areas which are seeing incredible traction with our
INFY_Q3_january_22_482 | clients.
INFY_Q3_january_22_483 | We have a strong modernization and automation leveraging Artificial Intelligence
INFY_Q3_january_22_484 | and Machine Learning - we will continue to build that out.
INFY_Q3_january_22_485 | Our approach is going to be to
INFY_Q3_january_22_486 | drive all of these through our current margin profile.
INFY_Q3_january_22_487 | That is what we will drive through as
INFY_Q3_january_22_488 | opposed to any new place for investments.
INFY_Q3_january_22_489 | Diviya Nagarajan
INFY_Q3_january_22_490 | Fair enough.
INFY_Q3_january_22_491 | One last bookkeeping question, your ‘Other’ segment had a big swing this
INFY_Q3_january_22_492 | quarter, is there anything particular that we should be looking at here, any one off or if not,
INFY_Q3_january_22_493 | what drove that.
INFY_Q3_january_22_494 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q3_january_22_495 | That is coming from India, where we have some seasonality with some of our clients
INFY_Q3_january_22_496 | towards the quarter end and you will see that in the geography sector of India.
INFY_Q3_january_22_497 | Diviya Nagarajan – UBS
INFY_Q3_january_22_498 | Got it, thank you and wish you all the best for 2022.

INFY_Q3_january_22_500 | go ahead.
INFY_Q3_january_22_501 | Ashwin Mehta
INFY_Q3_january_22_502 | I had one question on the third party bought out items for service delivery.
INFY_Q3_january_22_503 | That item
INFY_Q3_january_22_504 | seems to have gone up by almost $71 mn this quarter almost 1.8% of revenues, so just
INFY_Q3_january_22_505 | wanted to check what does this pertain to and is it possibly related to the data center
INFY_Q3_january_22_506 | takeovers that we would have done in some of our large deals.
INFY_Q3_january_22_507 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q3_january_22_508 | As we are looking at in many digital end-to-end transformation, whether IT as a service,
INFY_Q3_january_22_509 | full stack transformation, we have involved, infrastructure, SaaS, data, so it is a full stack
INFY_Q3_january_22_510 | transformation and in many cases, these involve infrastructure and software as well.
INFY_Q3_january_22_511 | These are bundled deals which are end-to-end transformation and we think they are
INFY_Q3_january_22_512 | important as well going ahead when we look at these digital transformations.
INFY_Q3_january_22_513 | So, I think as
INFY_Q3_january_22_514 | part of our overall deal profiles, we continue to see these deals giving us increased
INFY_Q3_january_22_515 | visibility into the organization IT infrastructure and allowing our future deals ahead once
INFY_Q3_january_22_516 | we are pretty much front and center in the IT landscape, so that’s what these are.
INFY_Q3_january_22_517 | Ashwin Mehta
INFY_Q3_january_22_518 | Just one last question, in terms of our margin outlook over the near term, do you think that
INFY_Q3_january_22_519 | with the attrition starting to on a quarterly annualized basis normalizing, the interventions
INFY_Q3_january_22_520 | that are required possibly go down in the near term so that we can possibly make a higher
INFY_Q3_january_22_521 | exit at the end of this year, so that we can maintain margins in the next year as well?
INFY_Q3_january_22_522 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q3_january_22_523 | As I said we have not seen a decline as yet, these are flattening and probably will start
INFY_Q3_january_22_524 | inching off, so we will continue to do what it takes to invest behind our employees because
INFY_Q3_january_22_525 | we know this is more under comfort range which we would be happy in.
INFY_Q3_january_22_526 | So, I think it is
INFY_Q3_january_22_527 | premature to say when this will really come off, but as of now we are focused in doing all
INFY_Q3_january_22_528 | these interventions.
INFY_Q3_january_22_529 | This quarter itself like we mentioned 80 basis points of our margin
INFY_Q3_january_22_530 | was behind these employee interventions.
INFY_Q3_january_22_531 | Ashwin Mehta
INFY_Q3_january_22_532 | Thanks a lot, congrats again and all the best.

INFY_Q3_january_22_536 | Good evening to the management team, happy New Year and thanks for taking my
INFY_Q3_january_22_537 | question.
INFY_Q3_january_22_538 | First, congratulations on a very good set of numbers.
INFY_Q3_january_22_539 | Salil, I have a very simple
INFY_Q3_january_22_540 | question, you see now you know, our core which is 41% to 42% of the business is
INFY_Q3_january_22_541 | stabilizing on a YoY basis, it is probably little growth is there, but digital continues to be at
INFY_Q3_january_22_542 | 40% plus growth, so if this trend continues next year, may be our core may become 32%
INFY_Q3_january_22_543 | to 33% of the overall pie, so what is your sense from a long term perspective, where do
INFY_Q3_january_22_544 | you see this core stabilizing or do you think it will be unfair to see them separately and in
INFY_Q3_january_22_545 | the next two to three years you think everything will converge together.
INFY_Q3_january_22_546 | So, any idea,
INFY_Q3_january_22_547 | anything which you can say on that front will be very helpful.
INFY_Q3_january_22_548 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q3_january_22_549 | Thanks for that question.
INFY_Q3_january_22_550 | First as you pointed out, the digital growth is strong at over 40%
INFY_Q3_january_22_551 | or 42% and that shows resilience, the demand profile and our portfolio which is
INFY_Q3_january_22_552 | overlapping.
INFY_Q3_january_22_553 | The key for the core, instead of looking at the percentage of the business, the
INFY_Q3_january_22_554 | key for us is really the core is now stable with a very small growth, so we did not see the
INFY_Q3_january_22_555 | decline that we had for some quarters and this makes it extremely strong for us.
INFY_Q3_january_22_556 | We have
INFY_Q3_january_22_557 | probably the best capability in automation and modernization across the industry and with
INFY_Q3_january_22_558 | this while everyone else’s core is still shrinking, ours will be stable or possibly even have a
INFY_Q3_january_22_559 | small uptick and that means we will be the most competitive in this area.
INFY_Q3_january_22_560 | So, I am looking
INFY_Q3_january_22_561 | at this as a very positive step.
INFY_Q3_january_22_562 | We of course have to maintain this, and we have to keep
INFY_Q3_january_22_563 | building out our automation capabilities.
INFY_Q3_january_22_564 | So, if we succeed in that, I think that is a very
INFY_Q3_january_22_565 | good outlook for us in the quarters ahead.
INFY_Q3_january_22_566 | Sandip Agarwal
INFY_Q3_january_22_567 | Thanks that is very helpful and best of luck for the current quarter.

INFY_Q3_january_22_570 | Nitin Padmanabhan
INFY_Q3_january_22_571 | Good evening, everyone and thanks for the opportunity.
INFY_Q3_january_22_572 | I had two questions.
INFY_Q3_january_22_573 | The first is
INFY_Q3_january_22_574 | on the employee side.
INFY_Q3_january_22_575 | If you look at the employee cost under cost of revenue, it has
INFY_Q3_january_22_576 | consistently been down as a percentage of revenue, it has actually below what it used to
INFY_Q3_january_22_577 | be pre-COVID and a lot of growth has actually been added on the subcon side and even if
INFY_Q3_january_22_578 | you look at the numbers, it looks like most of the additions are all freshers.
INFY_Q3_january_22_579 | So, keeping
INFY_Q3_january_22_580 | this dynamic in mind, just wanted to understand as we go forward and may be attrition
INFY_Q3_january_22_581 | normalizes, how do you see this subcon evolving from an operational perspective, do you
INFY_Q3_january_22_582 | think you will have to hire these subcontractors directly on to your rolls and would that
INFY_Q3_january_22_583 | involve slightly higher cost, so how should one think of this dynamic overall was the first
INFY_Q3_january_22_584 | question?
INFY_Q3_january_22_585 | The second question was around the digital proportion of the business has meaningfully
INFY_Q3_january_22_586 | gone up and if you look into the next year and I am sure it will be even higher.
INFY_Q3_january_22_587 | From that
INFY_Q3_january_22_588 | perspective does that mean that our ability to sort of garner price increases will be far
INFY_Q3_january_22_589 | higher going into next year than what you see today?
INFY_Q3_january_22_590 | Thank you.
INFY_Q3_january_22_591 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q3_january_22_592 | I will take the first question on subcon.
INFY_Q3_january_22_593 | As Salil said the demand environment is so strong
INFY_Q3_january_22_594 | that we do not want to leave anything on the table and therefore whether it is through
INFY_Q3_january_22_595 | subcon or through lateral or freshers, we will first intend to fulfill that demand and of
INFY_Q3_january_22_596 | course over a period of time we will optimize that entire structure.
INFY_Q3_january_22_597 | So, whether it is
INFY_Q3_january_22_598 | programmed to rehire some of the subcon, some of them we will of course lapse and then
INFY_Q3_january_22_599 | we will get the lateral hires, some will be promoted, so within that the dynamics will play
INFY_Q3_january_22_600 | itself out over the next year.
INFY_Q3_january_22_601 | But at the moment it is critical that we do not leave any
INFY_Q3_january_22_602 | demand in the table and of course this will remain a optimization lever for us.
INFY_Q3_january_22_603 | We were
INFY_Q3_january_22_604 | one of the lowest in the industry at about 6.9%, pre-COVID and we are above 11% now
INFY_Q3_january_22_605 | but this is the lever, we will have over the medium-term to optimize.
INFY_Q3_january_22_606 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q3_january_22_607 | On the pricing, as the digital work will increase what we have been putting in place which
INFY_Q3_january_22_608 | is demonstrating to our clients the value creation through digital will give us a larger
INFY_Q3_january_22_609 | opportunity for that because the revenue will be larger.
INFY_Q3_january_22_610 | So, I think your assumption is
INFY_Q3_january_22_611 | absolutely valid, you will have an additional ability to do that as long as we execute in that
INFY_Q3_january_22_612 | value.
INFY_Q3_january_22_613 | Nitin Padmanabhan
INFY_Q3_january_22_614 | Thanks for that.
INFY_Q3_january_22_615 | Just a clarification on the first answer, so on the first point considering
INFY_Q3_january_22_616 | fresher addition are so strong this year and subcon is so strong does it mean that next
INFY_Q3_january_22_617 | year our ability to add as many freshers will be little more inhibited, in the sense that we
INFY_Q3_january_22_618 | will need to focus a little more on laterals next year, is that a way to think about it?
INFY_Q3_january_22_619 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q3_january_22_620 | No.
INFY_Q3_january_22_621 | I do not think so.
INFY_Q3_january_22_622 | I think we will continue to have a very robust fresher program - it has
INFY_Q3_january_22_623 | always been there.
INFY_Q3_january_22_624 | We have a strong internal rotation program so people based on the
INFY_Q3_january_22_625 | skills, we take them through our reskilling program and we then move them to new project,
INFY_Q3_january_22_626 | promotions etc.
INFY_Q3_january_22_627 | So, in that sense we think it will be a combination of both laterals and
INFY_Q3_january_22_628 | freshers, and I do not think we see a change in that.
INFY_Q3_january_22_629 | Nitin Padmanabhan - Investec
INFY_Q3_january_22_630 | Fair enough.
INFY_Q3_january_22_631 | Thank you so much and all the very best.
INFY_Q3_january_22_632 | Margaret - Moderator
INFY_Q3_january_22_633 | Please go ahead.
INFY_Q3_january_22_634 | Sandeep Shah
INFY_Q3_january_22_635 | Thanks for the opportunity and congratulations on a solid execution both on revenue and
INFY_Q3_january_22_636 | margins.
INFY_Q3_january_22_637 | The first question is CY2021 or FY2022 had a benefit of mega deal wins
INFY_Q3_january_22_638 | especially from Vanguard as well as Daimler as well as some amount of pent-up demand
INFY_Q3_january_22_639 | for you as well as the industry.
INFY_Q3_january_22_640 | So, the question is entering into next year do you believe
INFY_Q3_january_22_641 | that these elements one has to take care in terms of tapering off any growth in the next
INFY_Q3_january_22_642 | year or you do believe the digital adoption or the cloud adoption journey has a low
INFY_Q3_january_22_643 | penetration which does not make us upset in looking in the next year in terms of the
INFY_Q3_january_22_644 | growth momentum?
INFY_Q3_january_22_645 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q3_january_22_646 | Thanks for your question.
INFY_Q3_january_22_647 | First, the guidance increase, as I am sure you are seeing this for
INFY_Q3_january_22_648 | the year ending March of this year.
INFY_Q3_january_22_649 | We are not yet commenting in terms of quantitative
INFY_Q3_january_22_650 | guidance for next year.
INFY_Q3_january_22_651 | What is clear nonetheless is the demand environment remains
INFY_Q3_january_22_652 | strong and our portfolio of services and capabilities, especially on cloud and digital are
INFY_Q3_january_22_653 | resonating well with clients so we see a good pipeline for that.
INFY_Q3_january_22_654 | Our large deals in this
INFY_Q3_january_22_655 | quarter also very strong.
INFY_Q3_january_22_656 | We continue to see a good large deal pipeline.
INFY_Q3_january_22_657 | We have seen a
INFY_Q3_january_22_658 | steady expansion of our clients over $50, $100, $200 mn and so on.
INFY_Q3_january_22_659 | We have seen that
INFY_Q3_january_22_660 | expansion within clients is working very well and also our new client wins and new
INFY_Q3_january_22_661 | accounts are working well.
INFY_Q3_january_22_662 | So overall we have the various elements of continuing this
INFY_Q3_january_22_663 | demand environment strongly but we do not have a specific guidance yet for year starting
INFY_Q3_january_22_664 | in April 1, 2022.
INFY_Q3_january_22_665 | Sandeep Shah
INFY_Q3_january_22_666 | Fair enough and just last two bookkeeping questions.
INFY_Q3_january_22_667 | The way I look at is Daimler deal
INFY_Q3_january_22_668 | has two legs to ramp up one being the rebadging and employee related ramp up and
INFY_Q3_january_22_669 | second being the pass-through data center related ramp up.
INFY_Q3_january_22_670 | Is it fair to say that most of
INFY_Q3_january_22_671 | these two legs ramp up is largely behind or may continue in Q4 as well as 1Q of next
INFY_Q3_january_22_672 | financial year and second in terms of FY2022 wage hike, is it largely over or something is
INFY_Q3_january_22_673 | due in the fourth quarter as well?
INFY_Q3_january_22_674 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q3_january_22_675 | On the Daimler, we do not have any more specifics.
INFY_Q3_january_22_676 | I can understand what you are
INFY_Q3_january_22_677 | looking for, but we have not gone into that specifics now with Q3 and Q4.
INFY_Q3_january_22_678 | The overall
INFY_Q3_january_22_679 | guidance for increase of the revenue covers all of that including Daimler and many other
INFY_Q3_january_22_680 | clients and especially with Q4 and the seasonality of that quarter.
INFY_Q3_january_22_681 | In terms of salary and compensation increases, we have done three of them for this year.
INFY_Q3_january_22_682 | There is nothing specific that is planned for Q4.
INFY_Q3_january_22_683 | We will start to look at what we will do in
INFY_Q3_january_22_684 | the next financial year but nothing specific is being planned in Q4.
INFY_Q3_january_22_685 | Sandeep Shah
INFY_Q3_january_22_686 | Thanks, and all the best Sir.

INFY_Q3_january_22_689 | Manik Taneja
INFY_Q3_january_22_690 | Thank you for the opportunity.
INFY_Q3_january_22_691 | Just wanted to understand we have seen a significant
INFY_Q3_january_22_692 | increase in offshore mix of revenues over the last 18 months and this quarter saw a slight
INFY_Q3_january_22_693 | aberration.
INFY_Q3_january_22_694 | What caused that and how do you see this going forward?
INFY_Q3_january_22_695 | Thank you.
INFY_Q3_january_22_696 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q3_january_22_697 | The mix has changed over the last 18 months with a lot of the remote working that was
INFY_Q3_january_22_698 | put in place and work from home allowing the work to be delivered from a different
INFY_Q3_january_22_699 | location with tremendous yields and efficiency.
INFY_Q3_january_22_700 | What we saw in the last quarter was, some
INFY_Q3_january_22_701 | things have opened up in terms of travel and we are also being extremely optimal in what
INFY_Q3_january_22_702 | we have done in the previous quarters and this is something that has given us more ability
INFY_Q3_january_22_703 | to drive connects with clients and growth.
INFY_Q3_january_22_704 | We see in the medium-term, tremendous
INFY_Q3_january_22_705 | opportunity for an efficient mix because clients have also seen that once the work is done
INFY_Q3_january_22_706 | remotely or work from home that more opportunity exists, there are work to be done from
INFY_Q3_january_22_707 | a location further away.
INFY_Q3_january_22_708 | So, in general as a medium-term trend we see that as a positive
INFY_Q3_january_22_709 | trend, we will have of course each quarter some movements up and down but as a longer-
INFY_Q3_january_22_710 | term trend we see that as a positive trend.
INFY_Q3_january_22_711 | Manik Taneja
INFY_Q3_january_22_712 | Thank you Salil.
INFY_Q3_january_22_713 | I had one more additional question.
INFY_Q3_january_22_714 | Just wanted to get your thoughts
INFY_Q3_january_22_715 | around what we are seeing from a revenue productivity metrics standpoint, for revenue
INFY_Q3_january_22_716 | per person standpoint and while there is significant amount of offshore shift over the last
INFY_Q3_january_22_717 | 18 months, we have seen utilization go up.
INFY_Q3_january_22_718 | So, what is causing the increase in revenue
INFY_Q3_january_22_719 | productivity despite a significant offshore shift that we have seen over the last 18 months.
INFY_Q3_january_22_720 | If you could talk about some of the factors that are driving it?
INFY_Q3_january_22_721 | Thank you.
INFY_Q3_january_22_722 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q3_january_22_723 | On the revenue productivity there are a number of things that are going on.
INFY_Q3_january_22_724 | We see some
INFY_Q3_january_22_725 | of the mix of our work which is also changing more to digital and there we see much more
INFY_Q3_january_22_726 | revenue productivity coming in.
INFY_Q3_january_22_727 | As you pointed out utilization has also gone up.
INFY_Q3_january_22_728 | We will
INFY_Q3_january_22_729 | also see some of our work, for example on the consulting side, data and analytics side
INFY_Q3_january_22_730 | growing well and that is giving us some level of boost.
INFY_Q3_january_22_731 | There is also some impact which
INFY_Q3_january_22_732 | we have not quantified externally on leveraging some amount of automation and platforms
INFY_Q3_january_22_733 | that gives us this benefit.
INFY_Q3_january_22_734 | So, there are several factors at work despite the onshore
INFY_Q3_january_22_735 | offshore mix changes.
INFY_Q3_january_22_736 | Manik Taneja
INFY_Q3_january_22_737 | Sure, thank you and all the best for future.

INFY_Q3_january_22_740 | Rahul Jain
INFY_Q3_january_22_741 | Thanks for the opportunity and congratulations.
INFY_Q3_january_22_742 | I have a question regarding the core
INFY_Q3_january_22_743 | revenue which has seen stabilization this year, I think you have addressed this point partly
INFY_Q3_january_22_744 | but wanted to understand what could be the prospect for this side of the revenue in the
INFY_Q3_january_22_745 | coming years especially when we talk about so much shift to digitalization?
INFY_Q3_january_22_746 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q3_january_22_747 | There we have no individual guidance for digital or for the core in that sense, even for Q4
INFY_Q3_january_22_748 | or for the next financial year.
INFY_Q3_january_22_749 | But structurally what is clear is we have been successful in
INFY_Q3_january_22_750 | driving automation and modernization while we make sure that we are probably the most
INFY_Q3_january_22_751 | competitive large player in the market, working with large clients.
INFY_Q3_january_22_752 | This certainly enhances
INFY_Q3_january_22_753 | the strong confidence and if we can continue to execute on that, it will have its own
INFY_Q3_january_22_754 | benefits in the medium term.
INFY_Q3_january_22_755 | Rahul Jain
INFY_Q3_january_22_756 | One more thing on the taxation part our tax rate you know steadily has been upwards of
INFY_Q3_january_22_757 | 27% on an average, this looks little higher given the country where most of our earnings
INFY_Q3_january_22_758 | belongs to so any flavor you can share in terms of what should be the ideal tax rate on a
INFY_Q3_january_22_759 | sustainable basis and in near-term?
INFY_Q3_january_22_760 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q3_january_22_761 | Our tax rate has always hovered around this 27%, 28% range and I do not think you will
INFY_Q3_january_22_762 | see much movement going against the range.
INFY_Q3_january_22_763 | Because in any case, as you know, this is
INFY_Q3_january_22_764 | India rate plus other countries.
INFY_Q3_january_22_765 | 25% is India-only rate.
INFY_Q3_january_22_766 | So I think, in the long run, you will
INFY_Q3_january_22_767 | be around this range itself.
INFY_Q3_january_22_768 | Rahul Jain
INFY_Q3_january_22_769 | So which regions tax rate are much higher than the 25% rate also for taking this number
INFY_Q3_january_22_770 | higher than the average?
INFY_Q3_january_22_771 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q3_january_22_772 | Yes, so see we cannot give that individually, but there are some jurisdictions and also in
INFY_Q3_january_22_773 | some jurisdiction where those taxes cannot be set off here as well, so it is a combination
INFY_Q3_january_22_774 | of both.
INFY_Q3_january_22_775 | Rahul Jain
INFY_Q3_january_22_776 | Okay so if we are not able to set that off those results in double taxation.
INFY_Q3_january_22_777 | That is also a
INFY_Q3_january_22_778 | reason okay got it thank you so much.

INFY_Q3_january_22_781 | James Friedman
INFY_Q3_january_22_782 | Let me echo the congratulations for this fiscal year.
INFY_Q3_january_22_783 | I just had one simple question across
INFY_Q3_january_22_784 | for Nilanjan, can you remind us what the capital allocation strategy is.
INFY_Q3_january_22_785 | I remember you had
INFY_Q3_january_22_786 | put it out during the analyst day in November 2020 but where is share repurchase in the
INFY_Q3_january_22_787 | prioritization.
INFY_Q3_january_22_788 | Thank you.
INFY_Q3_january_22_789 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q3_january_22_790 | What we had announced in FY20 basically, was that we have taken capital allocation to
INFY_Q3_january_22_791 | 85%, prior to this it was 70% and we said that we will take that over the period of 5 years
INFY_Q3_january_22_792 | through a combination of progressive growth-oriented dividend policy plus either share
INFY_Q3_january_22_793 | buyback or one off special dividends.
INFY_Q3_january_22_794 | And in the first two years, as we have announced,
INFY_Q3_january_22_795 | we have actually paid back 82% through higher increased normal dividends and also
INFY_Q3_january_22_796 | through share buyback which we announced last year.
INFY_Q3_january_22_797 | We have already paid back 82%
INFY_Q3_january_22_798 | and we remain quite committed to overall 85% over 5 years.
INFY_Q3_january_22_799 | James Friedman
INFY_Q3_january_22_800 | Got it.
INFY_Q3_january_22_801 | Thank you so much.

INFY_Q3_january_22_805 | Thank you for the opportunity and congratulations on a great quarter.
INFY_Q3_january_22_806 | My question is on
INFY_Q3_january_22_807 | your employee cost which partially has been addressed but how should we think about the
INFY_Q3_january_22_808 | core employee cost growth which comes under the cost of revenue which has seen
INFY_Q3_january_22_809 | around 4% CQGR increase over Q1 of FY2021 versus the 6% revenue growth and this
INFY_Q3_january_22_810 | has been in light of a very sharp increase in attrition and of course further supply
INFY_Q3_january_22_811 | challenges and etc.
INFY_Q3_january_22_812 | So, if you can just highlight, are our wage hikes in line with the
INFY_Q3_january_22_813 | industry or have they been much higher than the industry?
INFY_Q3_january_22_814 | How should we think about this
INFY_Q3_january_22_815 | historically and if you could give some kind of an outlook over there as well?
INFY_Q3_january_22_816 | Thanks.
INFY_Q3_january_22_817 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q3_january_22_818 | Yes, so you have to see both employee cost and subcon together as the cost of people as
INFY_Q3_january_22_819 | a combination, you cannot see one in isolation that is number one.
INFY_Q3_january_22_820 | Number two, just from
INFY_Q3_january_22_821 | an overall cost perspective, we of course are very focused on the attrition and being
INFY_Q3_january_22_822 | competitive in the markets as well as being employer of choice for many of our employee.
INFY_Q3_january_22_823 | Going ahead when we look at intervention on the compensation side like Salil said, we did
INFY_Q3_january_22_824 | across, in January, we did across the board, in July we have done across the board, in Q3
INFY_Q3_january_22_825 | as well we have done very segmented and for targeted talent and we will continue doing
INFY_Q3_january_22_826 | that into Q4 etc., looking at high points of attrition and doing it much more tactically to see
INFY_Q3_january_22_827 | where we are seeing demand being high in the markets for those skills and target those
INFY_Q3_january_22_828 | employees really.
INFY_Q3_january_22_829 | So, I think it is very nuanced like I said and we will continue doing that.
INFY_Q3_january_22_830 | Vimal Gohil
INFY_Q3_january_22_831 | Sir, so basically if we were to look at your guidance, it implies 0% to 2% sort of a revenue
INFY_Q3_january_22_832 | growth in Q4.
INFY_Q3_january_22_833 | Considering the fact that there were some furloughs in Q3, your revenue
INFY_Q3_january_22_834 | growth could be higher than what you have reported in Q3.
INFY_Q3_january_22_835 | So, is your guidance
INFY_Q3_january_22_836 | conservative at this point in time how should we think about that?
INFY_Q3_january_22_837 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q3_january_22_838 | In terms of the guidance, it was very strong.
INFY_Q3_january_22_839 | It is 19.5% to 20%.
INFY_Q3_january_22_840 | There is no further color in
INFY_Q3_january_22_841 | saying whether it is conservative, aggressive, or stable.
INFY_Q3_january_22_842 | We see a very good demand
INFY_Q3_january_22_843 | outlook; we see good large deals and good portfolio and the guidance is a very big move
INFY_Q3_january_22_844 | up from where we were in the last quarter.
INFY_Q3_january_22_845 | Vimal Gohil – Union AMC
INFY_Q3_january_22_846 | Fair enough Sir.

INFY_Q3_january_22_855 | This is Salil.
INFY_Q3_january_22_856 | Just to close from our side.
INFY_Q3_january_22_857 | First, thank you all for
INFY_Q3_january_22_858 | making your time.
INFY_Q3_january_22_859 | We feel extremely good about the quarter, 7% growth QoQ, 21.5% in
INFY_Q3_january_22_860 | YoY, very strong digital 42.6%, very good on large deals $2.5 bn.
INFY_Q3_january_22_861 | So overall we see
INFY_Q3_january_22_862 | excellent market demand and we are seeing market share gains which is a very good sign
INFY_Q3_january_22_863 | for us, primarily which are coming from a well positioned portfolio and a good execution
INFY_Q3_january_22_864 | from all our teams.
INFY_Q3_january_22_865 | Our revenue guidance of course has gone up from 19.5% to 20%,
INFY_Q3_january_22_866 | operating margins remains at a good level at 23.5% and we have good strong trust and
INFY_Q3_january_22_867 | confidence of our clients.
INFY_Q3_january_22_868 | Overall, a strong outlook and positive about what we see in the
INFY_Q3_january_22_869 | future for our digital and cloud transformation programs.
INFY_Q3_january_22_870 | With that thank you all wish you a Happy New Year and look forward to catching up in
