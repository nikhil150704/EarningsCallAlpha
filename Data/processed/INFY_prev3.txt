INFY_Q2_october_21_110 | Hello, everyone.
INFY_Q2_october_21_111 | Hope you and your family are doing good, safe, and healthy.
INFY_Q2_october_21_112 | Growth acceleration continued in Q2 with YoY constant currency growth at 19.4%.
INFY_Q2_october_21_113 | Q2 witnessed
INFY_Q2_october_21_114 | broad-based double-digit growth across all business segments and both North America and
INFY_Q2_october_21_115 | Europe.
INFY_Q2_october_21_116 | Operating parameters continued to improve further:
INFY_Q2_october_21_117 | -
INFY_Q2_october_21_118 | Utilization improved to a new all-time high of 89.2%
INFY_Q2_october_21_119 | -
INFY_Q2_october_21_120 | Onsite effort mix reduced further to a new low of 23.6%
INFY_Q2_october_21_121 | We won 22 large deals of over $50 mn totaling $2.2 bn TCV, 5 each in Financial Services and
INFY_Q2_october_21_122 | Energy, Utility, Resources and Services; 3 each in Retail and Manufacturing; 2 each in

INFY_Q2_october_21_128 | Client metrics improved with over $100 mn client count increasing to 35, an increase of 5 YoY.
INFY_Q2_october_21_129 | We
INFY_Q2_october_21_130 | added 117 new clients in the last quarter.
INFY_Q2_october_21_131 | Voluntary last 12-months attrition increased to 20.1%.
INFY_Q2_october_21_132 | While attrition has increased on the back of
INFY_Q2_october_21_133 | high industry growth and supply tightness, especially in the niche skill areas, we continue to fulfill
INFY_Q2_october_21_134 | client commitments through increased hiring, talent reskilling and higher usage of subcons.
INFY_Q2_october_21_135 | We
INFY_Q2_october_21_136 | have stepped up our hiring program and have added more than 11,600 talent employees on a net
INFY_Q2_october_21_137 | basis, highest ever in a single quarter.
INFY_Q2_october_21_138 | In H1 we on-boarded over 25,000 college graduates and for
INFY_Q2_october_21_139 | the full year, we have increased the college graduate hiring target to 45,000 globally.
INFY_Q2_october_21_140 | The vaccination drive for our employees and their dependents across locations continued
INFY_Q2_october_21_141 | unabated.
INFY_Q2_october_21_142 | Currently, over 86% Infoscions have received at least one dose of vaccine.
INFY_Q2_october_21_143 | Moving to business segments:
INFY_Q2_october_21_144 | Starting with Financial Services, I am happy to share that in the last quarter, Infosys was ranked
INFY_Q2_october_21_145 | #1 by HFS in the Banking and Financial Services Providers' top 10, 2021.
INFY_Q2_october_21_146 | As you are aware our
INFY_Q2_october_21_147 | YoY growth was over 20% on constant currency basis this quarter and this industry-leading growth
INFY_Q2_october_21_148 | has sustained over the past several quarters.
INFY_Q2_october_21_149 | We are seeing strong demand and momentum
INFY_Q2_october_21_150 | across all regions.
INFY_Q2_october_21_151 | North America, however, continues to lead growth as we execute on large
INFY_Q2_october_21_152 | transformation programs and win market share.
INFY_Q2_october_21_153 | Banks are increasingly focusing on virtual
INFY_Q2_october_21_154 | branches, improved customer experience through AI and analytics, and digital transformation led
INFY_Q2_october_21_155 | cost take out agenda.
INFY_Q2_october_21_156 | Our focused investments in building strong sub-vertical and platforms
INFY_Q2_october_21_157 | capabilities in regional banking, retirement services, mortgages, asset management, and
INFY_Q2_october_21_158 | payments are working as a differentiator in winning large deals and digital transformation
INFY_Q2_october_21_159 | programs.
INFY_Q2_october_21_160 | We are well positioned as full stack digital transformation player with combination of our
INFY_Q2_october_21_161 | domain plus technology plus operations plus digital transformation capabilities.
INFY_Q2_october_21_162 | Performance of Retail segment remained strong as clients continue to make investments in new
INFY_Q2_october_21_163 | digital capabilities in commerce, marketing, and supply chain areas.
INFY_Q2_october_21_164 | We are seeing focus on areas
INFY_Q2_october_21_165 | like a digital consumer, analytics, digital promotion, personalization, cybersecurity, etc.
INFY_Q2_october_21_166 | Our
INFY_Q2_october_21_167 | recently launched Equinox platform is seeing significant traction from both our existing and
INFY_Q2_october_21_168 | prospective clients.
INFY_Q2_october_21_169 | We have a strong pipeline and expect steady performance for the segment in
INFY_Q2_october_21_170 | the coming quarters.
INFY_Q2_october_21_171 | Communication segment performance improved meaningfully on both sequential and YoY basis
INFY_Q2_october_21_172 | on the back of ramp up earlier deal wins.
INFY_Q2_october_21_173 | We are witnessing increasing momentum for capex roll-
INFY_Q2_october_21_174 | out for 5G deployment across regions.
INFY_Q2_october_21_175 | Our 5G living labs, with its capabilities and the promise of
INFY_Q2_october_21_176 | future innovations, is a key differentiator in the 5G space for the CSPs and OEMs.
INFY_Q2_october_21_177 | Energy, Utility, Resources and Services vertical growth accelerated further with continued large
INFY_Q2_october_21_178 | deal wins.
INFY_Q2_october_21_179 | Clients in various subsegments are seeing return to normalcy and are prioritizing
INFY_Q2_october_21_180 | projects around cloud transformation, customer experience, data analytics, automation,
INFY_Q2_october_21_181 | cybersecurity, etc.
INFY_Q2_october_21_182 | In Energy, we have made good progress in developing the integrated ‘energy
INFY_Q2_october_21_183 | as a service’ solution, which aims to enable clients to access reliable low-carbon energy, use
INFY_Q2_october_21_184 | energy more efficiently and to optimize supply and demand across multiple users and assets
INFY_Q2_october_21_185 | without having to invest in additional energy infrastructure.
INFY_Q2_october_21_186 | Growth in the Manufacturing segment accelerated significantly, with the Daimler deal starting to
INFY_Q2_october_21_187 | ramp up.
INFY_Q2_october_21_188 | Growth in the last quarter was broad-based across Europe and the U.S., as well as
INFY_Q2_october_21_189 | across industrial, automotive, and aerospace industries.
INFY_Q2_october_21_190 | We are seeing traction in engineering,
INFY_Q2_october_21_191 | IoT, supply chain, cloud ERP, digital transformation, and cloud migration areas.
INFY_Q2_october_21_192 | The pipeline
INFY_Q2_october_21_193 | continues to be strong, and this provides the confidence that growth in manufacturing for Infosys
INFY_Q2_october_21_194 | will continue to be market-leading.
INFY_Q2_october_21_195 | Infosys BPM performance remained stable as most of the geographies are witnessing a slow
INFY_Q2_october_21_196 | return to normalcy.
INFY_Q2_october_21_197 | We see a good deal pipeline with a healthy share of digital deals.
INFY_Q2_october_21_198 | Share of digital to overall revenues, increased further to 56.1% in Q2, with a continued strong
INFY_Q2_october_21_199 | growth of 42.4% YoY in constant currency terms.
INFY_Q2_october_21_200 | We continue to see a big focus on digital
INFY_Q2_october_21_201 | transformation, especially around cloud, commerce, and employee experience as customers
INFY_Q2_october_21_202 | adjust to the permanent changes in both shopping habits and hybrid working.
INFY_Q2_october_21_203 | Cost takeouts has
INFY_Q2_october_21_204 | been surpassed by the improvement of digital experiences that increase sales and drive customer
INFY_Q2_october_21_205 | or employee loyalty.
INFY_Q2_october_21_206 | In the last quarter, we have been ranked as leader in nine digital services-related capabilities in
INFY_Q2_october_21_207 | the areas of cloud services, experience and design, big data and analytics, IoT and engineering,
INFY_Q2_october_21_208 | modernization and artificial intelligence.
INFY_Q2_october_21_209 | To conclude, I want to thank you for the wholehearted support and wishes that you have extended
INFY_Q2_october_21_210 | to Infosys over the years.
INFY_Q2_october_21_211 | Personally, I have thoroughly enjoyed the discussions with you and felt
INFY_Q2_october_21_212 | enriched from your insights.
INFY_Q2_october_21_213 | I wish you good health and success in your future endeavors.
INFY_Q2_october_21_214 | With that, I will hand it over to Nilanjan.
INFY_Q2_october_21_215 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q2_october_21_216 | families are safe and well.
INFY_Q2_october_21_217 | Revenue growth accelerated further in Q2 on the back of a very strong Q1.
INFY_Q2_october_21_218 | We had strong double-
INFY_Q2_october_21_219 | digit growth in all the business segments led by Manufacturing and Financial Services, which grew
INFY_Q2_october_21_220 | at 42.5% and 20.5%, respectively YoY in constant currency.
INFY_Q2_october_21_221 | Our largest geography, North
INFY_Q2_october_21_222 | America, also grew YoY at 23.1% in constant currency.
INFY_Q2_october_21_223 | Consequently, constant currency YoY
INFY_Q2_october_21_224 | growth increased to 19.4%, which is the highest growth in any quarter in the last 11 years.
INFY_Q2_october_21_225 | Sequential growth in Q2 also saw an acceleration to 6.3% in constant currency, which is the
INFY_Q2_october_21_226 | highest sequential revenue growth in any quarter in the last 6 years.
INFY_Q2_october_21_227 | Q2 margin remained resilient at 23.6% despite headwinds from salary increases for most of our
INFY_Q2_october_21_228 | employees, higher subcon costs and supply side challenges which were largely offset by
INFY_Q2_october_21_229 | improvements in operational parameters and scale benefits resulting from growth.
INFY_Q2_october_21_230 | The major components of the sequential margin movement are as follows:
INFY_Q2_october_21_231 | -
INFY_Q2_october_21_232 | 1.1% impact to the comp hikes given, effective July, to most of our employee base;
INFY_Q2_october_21_233 | -
INFY_Q2_october_21_234 | 0.5% increase in subcon costs,
INFY_Q2_october_21_235 | These were offset by:
INFY_Q2_october_21_236 | -
INFY_Q2_october_21_237 | 80 basis point benefit due to cost optimization and improvement in operating parameter,
INFY_Q2_october_21_238 | -
INFY_Q2_october_21_239 | a 50 basis points due to SG&A scale benefits, and
INFY_Q2_october_21_240 | -
INFY_Q2_october_21_241 | a 30 basis points benefit due to rupee and cross currency movement,
INFY_Q2_october_21_242 | Overall leading to a 10 basis points drop in sequential operating margins.
INFY_Q2_october_21_243 | Q2 EPS grew by 13% in dollar terms and 12.7% in rupee terms on a YoY basis.
INFY_Q2_october_21_244 | DSOs stood at 66 days, an improvement of four days versus the last quarter on the back of robust
INFY_Q2_october_21_245 | collection.
INFY_Q2_october_21_246 | Free cash flow for the quarter was healthy at $712 mn and as a percentage of net profit, was
INFY_Q2_october_21_247 | 97.1% for Q2 and 109.5% for H1.
INFY_Q2_october_21_248 | Yield on cash balance was 5.1% compared to 4.9% in Q1.
INFY_Q2_october_21_249 | We have completed the buyback of Rs.
INFY_Q2_october_21_250 | 9,200 crores on September 8 at an average price of
INFY_Q2_october_21_251 | approximately Rs.1,649 per share compared to a maximum buyback price of Rs.1,750 per share,
INFY_Q2_october_21_252 | leading to a 1.31% reduction in share capital.
INFY_Q2_october_21_253 | With this, the company has returned approximately
INFY_Q2_october_21_254 | 82% of the free cash flow for FY20 and FY21 through dividends and buybacks, close to the 85%
INFY_Q2_october_21_255 | stated in our five-year capital allocation policy.
INFY_Q2_october_21_256 | Even after the capital return, we continue to maintain a strong debt-free and liquid balance sheet.
INFY_Q2_october_21_257 | Consolidated cash and investments at the end of the last quarter was $4.42 bn.
INFY_Q2_october_21_258 | Return on equity increased further to 29.8%, an improvement of 3.1% over Q2 last year, driven by
INFY_Q2_october_21_259 | consistent performance and increased capital returns.
INFY_Q2_october_21_260 | The Board has also announced an interim dividend of Rs.15 per share, an increase of 25% over
INFY_Q2_october_21_261 | prior year interim dividend and equal to the final dividend of prior year.
INFY_Q2_october_21_262 | We see a robust demand environment, coupled with tightness in the supply side, which will result
INFY_Q2_october_21_263 | in higher recruitment, compensation and retention costs in the near future, along with seasonal
INFY_Q2_october_21_264 | headwinds relating to furloughs.
INFY_Q2_october_21_265 | However, we remain confident of our ability to partially offset
INFY_Q2_october_21_266 | some of these cost headwinds through the structural cost efficiency improvement measures and
INFY_Q2_october_21_267 | deliver well within our margin guidance for the year.
INFY_Q2_october_21_268 | With a strong H1 and a robust deal pipeline, we are increasing our revenue growth guidance for
INFY_Q2_october_21_269 | the year to 16.5% to 17.5% from 14% to 16% previously.
INFY_Q2_october_21_270 | We reiterate our operating margin
INFY_Q2_october_21_271 | guidance of 22% to 24% for the full year.
INFY_Q2_october_21_272 | With that, we can open the call for questions.
INFY_Q2_october_21_273 | Moderator
INFY_Q2_october_21_274 | Thank you very much.
INFY_Q2_october_21_275 | We will now begin the question-and-answer session.
INFY_Q2_october_21_276 | The first question is
INFY_Q2_october_21_277 | from the line of Ankur Rudra from JP Morgan.
INFY_Q2_october_21_278 | Please go ahead.
INFY_Q2_october_21_279 | Ankur Rudra
INFY_Q2_october_21_280 | Pravin best wishes for the future and congratulations on completing a great innings on a high.
INFY_Q2_october_21_281 | Overall, clearly, very good results, it is nice to see the margin execution and the guidance
INFY_Q2_october_21_282 | upgrade.
INFY_Q2_october_21_283 | To start off with Salil, if you could give us a sense about how you feel about demand
INFY_Q2_october_21_284 | visibility given where you see the increasing guidance, but we continue to see a drop in the large
INFY_Q2_october_21_285 | deals size.
INFY_Q2_october_21_286 | So how do we think about that?

INFY_Q2_october_21_288 | Thanks, Ankur, this is Salil.
INFY_Q2_october_21_289 | In terms of demand, we continue to see a good pipeline in terms of
INFY_Q2_october_21_290 | large deals.
INFY_Q2_october_21_291 | We are participating more in areas which relate to digital transformation, which relate
INFY_Q2_october_21_292 | to cloud work, which relate to data and analytics work.
INFY_Q2_october_21_293 | We see this across all industries and we
INFY_Q2_october_21_294 | see that large enterprises are accelerating their spend.
INFY_Q2_october_21_295 | Their trust in us is strong because of the
INFY_Q2_october_21_296 | capabilities we have built.
INFY_Q2_october_21_297 | So, the demand from that piece, which is the large deals, is looking good.
INFY_Q2_october_21_298 | Then there is the
INFY_Q2_october_21_299 | demand which is from our existing client base, where we are seeing a tremendous expansion in all
INFY_Q2_october_21_300 | of our large clients.
INFY_Q2_october_21_301 | Some of the stats on this are the number of clients over $100 mn and number
INFY_Q2_october_21_302 | of clients over $50 mn, both of which are expanding QoQ and as you look back to this time last
INFY_Q2_october_21_303 | year, YoY.
INFY_Q2_october_21_304 | With that, we feel good today to increase the revenue growth guidance and that is the clearest
INFY_Q2_october_21_305 | indication that the demand is looking quite good right now.
INFY_Q2_october_21_306 | So overall, we are still in a good shape
INFY_Q2_october_21_307 | with the demand and feeling quite confident with the way we have increased the guidance.
INFY_Q2_october_21_308 | Ankur Rudra
INFY_Q2_october_21_309 | Just a one thing on the talent supply side, how do you feel about the ability to meet with this
INFY_Q2_october_21_310 | continued strong demand?
INFY_Q2_october_21_311 | Maybe a comment on the graduate on-boarding, for example, have you
INFY_Q2_october_21_312 | been, able to reduce the time taken to billing from on-boarding for that part of the supply?
INFY_Q2_october_21_313 | Pravin Rao
INFY_Q2_october_21_314 | If you remember last quarter we had talked about 35,000 campus hires this year, but based on the
INFY_Q2_october_21_315 | demand outlook and increased attrition, we were able to quickly ramp up to 45,000 for this year.
INFY_Q2_october_21_316 | In
INFY_Q2_october_21_317 | fact this quarter, we added about 15,000 campus recruits, which was probably the highest ever in
INFY_Q2_october_21_318 | Infosys history.
INFY_Q2_october_21_319 | So today, we have the ability to recruit campus hires because of the investments we have made in
INFY_Q2_october_21_320 | assessment platforms, the InfyTQ and another thing which allows us to access talent anywhere in
INFY_Q2_october_21_321 | India or even globally for that matter and the turnaround time is much faster.
INFY_Q2_october_21_322 | So, we are pretty
INFY_Q2_october_21_323 | confident and if there is a need to revise it further based on our needs, we are more than equipped
INFY_Q2_october_21_324 | to deal with it.
INFY_Q2_october_21_325 | Ankur Rudra
INFY_Q2_october_21_326 | Understood and just a last question on margins, Nilanjan, clearly very good execution this time.
INFY_Q2_october_21_327 | In
INFY_Q2_october_21_328 | terms of the headwinds and the tailwinds you see for us now, would it be fair to assume the
INFY_Q2_october_21_329 | headwinds are behind us?
INFY_Q2_october_21_330 | And could you also comment about why not narrow the margin band,
INFY_Q2_october_21_331 | while the revenue band has been narrowed?
INFY_Q2_october_21_332 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q2_october_21_333 | As we have talked about, we have done this compensation hike in Q2 and we will continue doing
INFY_Q2_october_21_334 | what is necessary, and in fact, Pravin also mentioned in Q3 we have also rolled out skill-based
INFY_Q2_october_21_335 | plans.
INFY_Q2_october_21_336 | Also, the cost of hiring is going up so we will see some headwinds along with the seasonal
INFY_Q2_october_21_337 | headwinds of furloughs and working days in the near future.
INFY_Q2_october_21_338 | But overall, I think for the margin
INFY_Q2_october_21_339 | guidance perspective, we are quite comfortable to stay within the 22% to 24%.
INFY_Q2_october_21_340 | And historically, as
INFY_Q2_october_21_341 | we have seen we have never changed the margin guidance.
INFY_Q2_october_21_342 | This is more of an operating band we
INFY_Q2_october_21_343 | are comfortable to be in.
INFY_Q2_october_21_344 | So, we do not narrow that down historically.

INFY_Q2_october_21_347 | Congrats on strong results and Pravin, we are going to miss you.
INFY_Q2_october_21_348 | It has been a great experience
INFY_Q2_october_21_349 | working with you and best of luck.
INFY_Q2_october_21_350 | Two questions, one can you talk a bit about what we are doing
INFY_Q2_october_21_351 | to contain the attrition rates that have been pretty high.
INFY_Q2_october_21_352 | Maybe there is a way to also break down
INFY_Q2_october_21_353 | attrition by voluntary and involuntary?
INFY_Q2_october_21_354 | The other question is more broad-based.
INFY_Q2_october_21_355 | Salil, looking at the
INFY_Q2_october_21_356 | budget cycle for calendar 2022, maybe it is a bit too early, but are you getting any specific
INFY_Q2_october_21_357 | indications about budgets for next year?
INFY_Q2_october_21_358 | And in that context, the strong growth that we are seeing
INFY_Q2_october_21_359 | this year, do we feel that this is still part of that multi-year spending cycle that the entry has been
INFY_Q2_october_21_360 | talking about for a couple of quarters?
INFY_Q2_october_21_361 | Thanks a lot.
INFY_Q2_october_21_362 | Pravin Rao
INFY_Q2_october_21_363 | Thank you very much for the wishes.
INFY_Q2_october_21_364 | From a voluntary attrition perspective, as we mentioned on
INFY_Q2_october_21_365 | an LTM basis, it increased to 20.1%.
INFY_Q2_october_21_366 | Most of the attrition has been for people in lower JL’s
INFY_Q2_october_21_367 | between 3 to 6 years of experience and this has been the trend in this industry.
INFY_Q2_october_21_368 | Because in this
INFY_Q2_october_21_369 | experience levels, people are still not emotionally connected with the company and sometimes, it
INFY_Q2_october_21_370 | is easier to move around and that is what we are seeing this time around as well.
INFY_Q2_october_21_371 | As I mentioned earlier that this is because of unprecedented demand, as well as the in some
INFY_Q2_october_21_372 | geographies we have also seen lack of talent mobility that has also fueled attrition in some of the
INFY_Q2_october_21_373 | countries.
INFY_Q2_october_21_374 | Obviously, we expect this to perhaps continue for a couple of quarters or so, but once
INFY_Q2_october_21_375 | we have more talent available in the system this should ease and get back to the earlier levels.
INFY_Q2_october_21_376 | But
INFY_Q2_october_21_377 | having said that, we have done significant interventions to contain this.
INFY_Q2_october_21_378 | We have had two rounds of
INFY_Q2_october_21_379 | compensation reviews, skill-based correction for high demand skills, targeted retention for new
INFY_Q2_october_21_380 | skills, a higher number of promotions, and so on.
INFY_Q2_october_21_381 | We are also focused a lot on mobility of people,
INFY_Q2_october_21_382 | we have hired a lot of IJPs, we have focused a lot on employee engagement, over close to 5,000
INFY_Q2_october_21_383 | employee connect sessions, a lot of focus on career development, continuous learning.
INFY_Q2_october_21_384 | We have
INFY_Q2_october_21_385 | introduced new career paths like digital specialists, we have BITS programs, and we also
INFY_Q2_october_21_386 | launched several wellness initiatives as well.
INFY_Q2_october_21_387 | And as we talk, we are also ramping up our entry-
INFY_Q2_october_21_388 | level, hiring in an aggressive way so that we are able to meet some of the demands that are out
INFY_Q2_october_21_389 | there.
INFY_Q2_october_21_390 | In the long term, we are also taking a fresh look at the talent strategy approach.
INFY_Q2_october_21_391 | This is not
INFY_Q2_october_21_392 | only due to the current high attrition, but also our belief is that there will be fundamental shifts in
INFY_Q2_october_21_393 | employee thinking behavior in the post-COVID world.
INFY_Q2_october_21_394 | And that means you have to relook at the
INFY_Q2_october_21_395 | employee value proposition and fine-tune that.
INFY_Q2_october_21_396 | So that is something we have started taking a hard
INFY_Q2_october_21_397 | look at.
INFY_Q2_october_21_398 | That is from an attrition and talent perspective.
INFY_Q2_october_21_399 | In terms of the budgets, I think in the current context, budgets are no longer relevant, in that
INFY_Q2_october_21_400 | sense, because there is a lot of pent-up demand; and at least this will continue for a few quarters,
INFY_Q2_october_21_401 | if not years.
INFY_Q2_october_21_402 | And there are various reports that talk about tech intensity increasing from 3 to 5
INFY_Q2_october_21_403 | impact.
INFY_Q2_october_21_404 | One of the Gartner reports talked about the kind of spend in the next 2 to 3 years, one can
INFY_Q2_october_21_405 | probably go back to 2010 to see that kind of demand.
INFY_Q2_october_21_406 | In that context, my own sense is while
INFY_Q2_october_21_407 | budget, maybe, an operational thing that people will actually do that, but it may not have relevance
INFY_Q2_october_21_408 | because there is enough and more demand at least for the next few quarters.

INFY_Q2_october_21_411 | Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a strong execution in the quarter.
INFY_Q2_october_21_412 | Just a couple of
INFY_Q2_october_21_413 | questions from my end, could you talk about the puts and the takes that you had for margins this
INFY_Q2_october_21_414 | quarter, I believe there are some headwinds as well.
INFY_Q2_october_21_415 | So, run us through how you have managed to
INFY_Q2_october_21_416 | maintain margins in terms of the percentage, that is question number 1?
INFY_Q2_october_21_417 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q2_october_21_418 | I think with my opening remarks it was quite straightforward in the margin walk.
INFY_Q2_october_21_419 | The compensation
INFY_Q2_october_21_420 | hike which was broad-based across, this is sequentially, that was 1.1%, impact, we had a 50 basis
INFY_Q2_october_21_421 | points hit on subcon, we have seen subcon cost going up due to higher fulfillment.
INFY_Q2_october_21_422 | These were
INFY_Q2_october_21_423 | offset by about 80 basis points due to cost optimization and other operating parameters, 50 basis
INFY_Q2_october_21_424 | points on scale benefits on SG&A and finally, a 30-basis points benefit on rupee and cross-
INFY_Q2_october_21_425 | currency movements.
INFY_Q2_october_21_426 | I think the comp-hikes and subcons were negated by cost optimization and
INFY_Q2_october_21_427 | scale benefits.
INFY_Q2_october_21_428 | Diviya Nagarajan
INFY_Q2_october_21_429 | I think, Pravin, you talked about the Daimler contract having started to ramp up this quarter.
INFY_Q2_october_21_430 | Could
INFY_Q2_october_21_431 | you give us some sense on how many months or weeks of revenue contribution came in from that,
INFY_Q2_october_21_432 | and was there any impact at all from that contract on margins?
INFY_Q2_october_21_433 | Were there any pass-through
INFY_Q2_october_21_434 | revenues or anything that is yet to come or how should we think about that going forward?
INFY_Q2_october_21_435 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q2_october_21_436 | Of course, Daimler has kicked in during the quarter, and its impact like I said you can see in
INFY_Q2_october_21_437 | Manufacturing.
INFY_Q2_october_21_438 | But even if you strip that out – we cannot give the numbers – we can see broad-
INFY_Q2_october_21_439 | based growth across all sectors, both on a sequential and a YoY basis.
INFY_Q2_october_21_440 | So, like I said earlier, it is
INFY_Q2_october_21_441 | more than icing on the cake rather than impacting the underlying growth.
INFY_Q2_october_21_442 | Diviya Nagarajan
INFY_Q2_october_21_443 | My last question is, how should we think about seasonality going into December and March?
INFY_Q2_october_21_444 | Should we expect normal seasonality as your guidance seems to suggest that you are looking up
INFY_Q2_october_21_445 | a fair amount of seasonal slowdown coming in at the top end as well.
INFY_Q2_october_21_446 | Is that something that is
INFY_Q2_october_21_447 | driven by holidays or do you think that is a normalization of demand that is coming in as well?
INFY_Q2_october_21_448 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q2_october_21_449 | There is always seasonality that you referenced, which I know you are aware of in Q3 and Q4.
INFY_Q2_october_21_450 | Especially in Q3, we will typically see some level of furloughs and typically, at least at Infosys, our
INFY_Q2_october_21_451 | Q4 trend down historically.
INFY_Q2_october_21_452 | Having said that, the demand environment today looks extremely
INFY_Q2_october_21_453 | strong.
INFY_Q2_october_21_454 | So, we have tried to balance those two things, in increasing our guidance significantly from
INFY_Q2_october_21_455 | 14%, 16% to 16.5% to 17.5%; yet making sure that we add everything that we know of today to
INFY_Q2_october_21_456 | deliver to that high level of growth.
INFY_Q2_october_21_457 | So, we will see some seasonality but there is a good overall
INFY_Q2_october_21_458 | demand outlook as well.
INFY_Q2_october_21_459 | Diviya Nagarajan
INFY_Q2_october_21_460 | Thanks for taking my question.
INFY_Q2_october_21_461 | Pravin, it has been a pleasure working with you.
INFY_Q2_october_21_462 | Hope to stay in
INFY_Q2_october_21_463 | touch.
INFY_Q2_october_21_464 | And I will come back in the queue if there is time.

INFY_Q2_october_21_468 | Good evening.
INFY_Q2_october_21_469 | Thanks for taking my question.
INFY_Q2_october_21_470 | Congratulation on a great set of numbers and best
INFY_Q2_october_21_471 | of luck Pravin for your great stint and ahead.
INFY_Q2_october_21_472 | I have only one question, now Salil, if you see our
INFY_Q2_october_21_473 | composition of business, we have more than half of the business coming in from digital and the
INFY_Q2_october_21_474 | way the growth is coming in, it looks like the next couple of years we will be probably three-fourth
INFY_Q2_october_21_475 | of digital.
INFY_Q2_october_21_476 | So my question is in the next couple of years does that not mean that structurally the
INFY_Q2_october_21_477 | industry is moving towards high-growth, if we see it from a longer-term perspective, or do you think
INFY_Q2_october_21_478 | that will be some saturation also in the digital growth, which we may see after a couple of years,
INFY_Q2_october_21_479 | any thought on that front?
INFY_Q2_october_21_480 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q2_october_21_481 | In terms of what we are seeing with clients today, the capabilities that we have built out, for
INFY_Q2_october_21_482 | example, Cobalt, we have also launched and announced other capability called Equinox, which is
INFY_Q2_october_21_483 | relating more to everything which is online in the e-commerce space,  other areas of digital where
INFY_Q2_october_21_484 | we have invested and scaled up over the past few years, in those areas we are seeing the
INFY_Q2_october_21_485 | demand very strong in today.
INFY_Q2_october_21_486 | It is difficult to say in that two-year horizon that you are mentioning.
INFY_Q2_october_21_487 | Our growth guidance really is for this year where we have expanded it, but everything would
INFY_Q2_october_21_488 | indicate to me that this scaling up, this digital work transformation is something which is ongoing.
INFY_Q2_october_21_489 | And many large enterprises are at the early stages of their digital and cloud journey.
INFY_Q2_october_21_490 | So, I do not
INFY_Q2_october_21_491 | get the sense that we are in the late stage, but in terms of really the guidance, we are focused on
INFY_Q2_october_21_492 | this year.
INFY_Q2_october_21_493 | But overall, I am quite optimistic that this is a good place to be in terms of the future.
INFY_Q2_october_21_494 | Sandip Agarwal
INFY_Q2_october_21_495 | Thanks a lot.
INFY_Q2_october_21_496 | That is all from my side and best of luck for the current quarter.

INFY_Q2_october_21_500 | Thanks for the opportunity.
INFY_Q2_october_21_501 | Pravin, this increase in the fresher intake to 45,000 is this a one-time
INFY_Q2_october_21_502 | because of the current situation or you think there is a structural shift in the way we are going to
INFY_Q2_october_21_503 | hire?
INFY_Q2_october_21_504 | If you can give some sense of what kind of plans you have for offers in next year?
INFY_Q2_october_21_505 | Pravin Rao
INFY_Q2_october_21_506 | It is obviously based on the current demand outlook that we are seeing and high attrition.
INFY_Q2_october_21_507 | It is too
INFY_Q2_october_21_508 | early to comment whether this will be a structural shift.
INFY_Q2_october_21_509 | But if whatever we are seeing and hearing,
INFY_Q2_october_21_510 | if this demand continues for the next several quarters, then given the shortage of talent you will
INFY_Q2_october_21_511 | probably see a higher number of such fresher recruitment globally.
INFY_Q2_october_21_512 | It is a bit early to think about
INFY_Q2_october_21_513 | next year, but at this stage, we believe that it will be on similar lines that we have recruited this
INFY_Q2_october_21_514 | year but we will take a look at it on a QoQ basis.
INFY_Q2_october_21_515 | And as I mentioned earlier, to one of the
INFY_Q2_october_21_516 | questions, today, our ability to recruit on a dynamic basis is much higher, given the virtual ways,
INFY_Q2_october_21_517 | our investment in platform, ability to assess candidates all through the year through the online
INFY_Q2_october_21_518 | platform etc.
INFY_Q2_october_21_519 | So, we will take look at it.
INFY_Q2_october_21_520 | So, at this stage our sense is, next year also would be on
INFY_Q2_october_21_521 | similar lines, but it is difficult to comment beyond that.
INFY_Q2_october_21_522 | Pankaj Kapoor
INFY_Q2_october_21_523 | Salil my question was also on the renewal that we have been seeing which have been obviously
INFY_Q2_october_21_524 | pretty dominating in the last 2, 3 quarters.
INFY_Q2_october_21_525 | Our new deal wins seem to be just around less than
INFY_Q2_october_21_526 | 40% of the total large deal wins.
INFY_Q2_october_21_527 | Any sense in terms of what could be the reason behind it?
INFY_Q2_october_21_528 | Are
INFY_Q2_october_21_529 | you seeing fewer number of those mega contracts which were there, say 4 quarters back, are
INFY_Q2_october_21_530 | clients taking slightly longer-term in time to decide on them, or are you seeing them getting
INFY_Q2_october_21_531 | restructured more into smaller contracts?
INFY_Q2_october_21_532 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q2_october_21_533 | The way we look at it, is first, where we have an existing relationship and long-term work, we are
INFY_Q2_october_21_534 | very clear that we want to make sure that the clients trust in us, gives us a longer stay, extension
INFY_Q2_october_21_535 | and typically some level of expansion.
INFY_Q2_october_21_536 | And that is why it is more critical for us to need to look at
INFY_Q2_october_21_537 | the renewals in absolute value because that is depending on when those contracts come up; we
INFY_Q2_october_21_538 | want to make sure that that continues.
INFY_Q2_october_21_539 | In terms of the new work, what we are seeing, as Pravin shared earlier, we had 22 large deals.
INFY_Q2_october_21_540 | Large deals, for us being deals over $50 mn in the quarter and that number is robust when we
INFY_Q2_october_21_541 | compare the number for H1 versus last H1, that is very robust.
INFY_Q2_october_21_542 | The one distinction is a mega-deal
INFY_Q2_october_21_543 | that we had last year in this quarter.
INFY_Q2_october_21_544 | Those things in terms of mega-deals are things which are
INFY_Q2_october_21_545 | difficult to predict which quarter they will show up in.
INFY_Q2_october_21_546 | In our pipeline, we have a good representation of those.
INFY_Q2_october_21_547 | Overall, the pipeline is quite strong.
INFY_Q2_october_21_548 | So, at
INFY_Q2_october_21_549 | this stage, given all of those things, we have chosen to increase our guidance and therefore
INFY_Q2_october_21_550 | remain quite positive on the outlook that is there for our businesses.

INFY_Q2_october_21_557 | Hi, and let me echo the congratulations Pravin, I have learned a lot from you over the years and I
INFY_Q2_october_21_558 | appreciate it.
INFY_Q2_october_21_559 | I know you keep getting asked about this, but we do too.
INFY_Q2_october_21_560 | Any sense at this point
INFY_Q2_october_21_561 | when or if you would see stabilization in the attrition at the industry level?
INFY_Q2_october_21_562 | And where is the
INFY_Q2_october_21_563 | industry losing the people to?
INFY_Q2_october_21_564 | Are they going to tech pure plays, to your customers, to captives, we
INFY_Q2_october_21_565 | are just wondering about that?
INFY_Q2_october_21_566 | Thank you.
INFY_Q2_october_21_567 | Pravin Rao
INFY_Q2_october_21_568 | I think at this stage, maybe in the next 2 to 3 quarters, perhaps the attrition will stabilize given such
INFY_Q2_october_21_569 | influx of talent.
INFY_Q2_october_21_570 | The demand is far outstripping talent supply that is available even globally, and that
INFY_Q2_october_21_571 | is why we are seeing this phenomenon not only with us, but across the industry, and we have
INFY_Q2_october_21_572 | seen this even in other industries as well.
INFY_Q2_october_21_573 | In terms of where they are going, it is a common thing,
INFY_Q2_october_21_574 | right?
INFY_Q2_october_21_575 | Typically, we lose people to competition and we also recruit from competition, so that is one
INFY_Q2_october_21_576 | part.
INFY_Q2_october_21_577 | But again, we are also losing people to captives, some of the hyperscalers have also started
INFY_Q2_october_21_578 | recruiting, and of course, in India startups now again have become very attractive with a lot of
INFY_Q2_october_21_579 | Unicorns and so on.
INFY_Q2_october_21_580 | That is a combination of things and I think the only way it can stabilize is to
INFY_Q2_october_21_581 | influx more talent into the mix, and that we believe probably in the next two to three quarters, will
INFY_Q2_october_21_582 | happen and with aggressive reskilling and we should be able to bring it back under control.

INFY_Q2_october_21_584 | Thank you, Pravin, all the best.

INFY_Q2_october_21_586 | go ahead.
INFY_Q2_october_21_587 | Sudheer Guntupalli
INFY_Q2_october_21_588 | Good evening gentlemen.
INFY_Q2_october_21_589 | Thanks for giving me this opportunity and congrats on a good quarter.
INFY_Q2_october_21_590 | Firstly, Nilanjan on the effort mix, onsite-offshore, I am curious as to why has the onsite share of
INFY_Q2_october_21_591 | effort come down in this quarter, despite the Daimler deal ramp up and in the initial phases I would
INFY_Q2_october_21_592 | have expected that the ramp-up would show us a higher share of onsite, that is number 1.
INFY_Q2_october_21_593 | And
INFY_Q2_october_21_594 | then a little bit of travel has also opened up but not completely.
INFY_Q2_october_21_595 | So, despite these two reasons I
INFY_Q2_october_21_596 | believe you are able to show a higher offshore effort, in this quarter.
INFY_Q2_october_21_597 | Any sense on what might be
INFY_Q2_october_21_598 | driving that?
INFY_Q2_october_21_599 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q2_october_21_600 | Yes, like I said, Daimler is not just one contract we have.
INFY_Q2_october_21_601 | It is a large business which we run and
INFY_Q2_october_21_602 | we also had Daimler ramp-up in the last quarter, it is not suddenly that everybody is onsite on one
INFY_Q2_october_21_603 | day.
INFY_Q2_october_21_604 | So, you would see these blips on onsite-offshore mix and last quarter it was flatter but now
INFY_Q2_october_21_605 | you have seen movement.
INFY_Q2_october_21_606 | But I think more importantly to see secular trend, like I said, this
INFY_Q2_october_21_607 | demand is at a global level.
INFY_Q2_october_21_608 | I think where it is going to really sustain from?
INFY_Q2_october_21_609 | In the long run it is
INFY_Q2_october_21_610 | going to be from talent here, because that is quantity and scale, and digitally skilled talent is
INFY_Q2_october_21_611 | largely available in India.
INFY_Q2_october_21_612 | So, while we continue to hire locally in large numbers.
INFY_Q2_october_21_613 | In our localization,
INFY_Q2_october_21_614 | the U.S. has already reached 70%.
INFY_Q2_october_21_615 | We announced more than 10,000 additional hires over 2
INFY_Q2_october_21_616 | years.
INFY_Q2_october_21_617 | But despite that, you will see the volume growth and the mix within that if you continue to
INFY_Q2_october_21_618 | technically move towards more offshore.
INFY_Q2_october_21_619 | Sudheer Guntupalli
INFY_Q2_october_21_620 | Pravin, my second question, if you actually look at the experience bucket you spoke about where
INFY_Q2_october_21_621 | we had seen the highest attrition, which is in the 2 to 6-year bucket.
INFY_Q2_october_21_622 | So, at this level or perhaps at
INFY_Q2_october_21_623 | the entry-level if we had seen, the last 10 years, industry has not seen much of salary revisions.
INFY_Q2_october_21_624 | On a real rupee basis, if you see, perhaps it would have been in the negative territory.
INFY_Q2_october_21_625 | I am not
INFY_Q2_october_21_626 | talking just about Infosys, but for the entire industry.
INFY_Q2_october_21_627 | Now given the kind of demand we are seeing
INFY_Q2_october_21_628 | for this experience bucket, can we expect some sort of a structural increase in the salary levels,
INFY_Q2_october_21_629 | which can have a longer-term impact on margins, let us say 1 or 2 years down the line, when the
INFY_Q2_october_21_630 | demand might not be as robust as it is today?
INFY_Q2_october_21_631 | Pravin Rao
INFY_Q2_october_21_632 | When companies recruit people at entry levels, we have to also invest a lot in training and
INFY_Q2_october_21_633 | enabling them.
INFY_Q2_october_21_634 | They take a while before they become productive, but as they move up the system,
INFY_Q2_october_21_635 | their salaries increase dramatically.
INFY_Q2_october_21_636 | So, for the people between 2-6 years of experience who are
INFY_Q2_october_21_637 | quitting, they would have got a good salary along the way as well.
INFY_Q2_october_21_638 | So, I do not see the entry-level
INFY_Q2_october_21_639 | salary dramatically changing in any way.
INFY_Q2_october_21_640 | There will be some corrections here and there.
INFY_Q2_october_21_641 | But at the
INFY_Q2_october_21_642 | same time, at least from our perspective we have also started differentiating at entry level itself.
INFY_Q2_october_21_643 | We have created two set of streams, one called Power Programmers and other one is called
INFY_Q2_october_21_644 | Digital Specialists; and in these streams, we are recruiting them at a much higher compensation.
INFY_Q2_october_21_645 | And there is a very stringent criteria for selecting these candidates based on their background as
INFY_Q2_october_21_646 | well as passing a couple of tests.
INFY_Q2_october_21_647 | If people are able to pass that then we recruit them in these two
INFY_Q2_october_21_648 | streams at a much higher compensation.
INFY_Q2_october_21_649 | Because at the entry-level, we are recruiting at scale,
INFY_Q2_october_21_650 | right?
INFY_Q2_october_21_651 | But within that we are trying to differentiate, and where we feel that people come with very
INFY_Q2_october_21_652 | strong skills capabilities and they can be deployed immediately, we are looking at the different
INFY_Q2_october_21_653 | compensation rates.
INFY_Q2_october_21_654 | Sudheer Guntupalli
INFY_Q2_october_21_655 | Thanks, Pravin.
INFY_Q2_october_21_656 | As always, interactions with you have always been very insightful.
INFY_Q2_october_21_657 | Congrats and
INFY_Q2_october_21_658 | all the best for your future endeavors.
INFY_Q2_october_21_659 | Moderator
INFY_Q2_october_21_660 | Please go ahead.
INFY_Q2_october_21_661 | Keith Bachman
INFY_Q2_october_21_662 | Hi, thank you very much.
INFY_Q2_october_21_663 | I wanted to also ask about attrition.
INFY_Q2_october_21_664 | You did make the comment that you
INFY_Q2_october_21_665 | think attrition improves next year, and I do not disagree with you, but I wanted to understand your
INFY_Q2_october_21_666 | thinking and more specifically, is it because demand slows across the industry?
INFY_Q2_october_21_667 | And as you
INFY_Q2_october_21_668 | referenced, it is an industry issue.
INFY_Q2_october_21_669 | And that allows attrition to improve or there is some something
INFY_Q2_october_21_670 | fundamentally that you think demand can stay at these levels or maybe moderate a touch, but you
INFY_Q2_october_21_671 | can continue to hire more freshers to meet that.
INFY_Q2_october_21_672 | But it is an industry problem.
INFY_Q2_october_21_673 | Your numbers
INFY_Q2_october_21_674 | increased substantially QoQ on attrition.
INFY_Q2_october_21_675 | And so just wanted to understand a little bit more about,
INFY_Q2_october_21_676 | why you think attrition improves, because there is such a significant industry problem, not just an
INFY_Q2_october_21_677 | Infosys issue.
INFY_Q2_october_21_678 | And then I have a follow-up, please.
INFY_Q2_october_21_679 | Pravin Rao
INFY_Q2_october_21_680 | We are saying that the attrition will stabilize, primarily because of the influx of talent.
INFY_Q2_october_21_681 | The demand
INFY_Q2_october_21_682 | will continue.
INFY_Q2_october_21_683 | In the near future, we are not seeing demand coming down by any accounts.
INFY_Q2_october_21_684 | But
INFY_Q2_october_21_685 | today there is a shortage of talent and particularly in some of the geographies because of travel
INFY_Q2_october_21_686 | restrictions, we are not even able to deploy people from India in those geographies where there is
INFY_Q2_october_21_687 | a need.
INFY_Q2_october_21_688 | But over a period of time, not only Infosys, but almost every company, many of our peers
INFY_Q2_october_21_689 | have also started announcing, talking about aggressive hiring from campuses, right?
INFY_Q2_october_21_690 | So that will
INFY_Q2_october_21_691 | result in higher availability of talent.
INFY_Q2_october_21_692 | And once we can hire this talent and skill them appropriately,
INFY_Q2_october_21_693 | they will then be available to be deployed and to meet the demand and that is when we expect the
INFY_Q2_october_21_694 | attrition to come down.
INFY_Q2_october_21_695 | Right now, the demand far outstrips the supply and that is where the
INFY_Q2_october_21_696 | challenges is.
INFY_Q2_october_21_697 | Keith Bachman
INFY_Q2_october_21_698 | Okay.
INFY_Q2_october_21_699 | Do you think this suggests a different headcount management strategy?
INFY_Q2_october_21_700 | In other words, do
INFY_Q2_october_21_701 | you think you need to diversify?
INFY_Q2_october_21_702 | Because it sounds like the problem is much more significant in
INFY_Q2_october_21_703 | India versus other markets does this, you think, suggest a broadening of your reach in terms of
INFY_Q2_october_21_704 | supply capabilities, in Eastern Europe or otherwise?
INFY_Q2_october_21_705 | Does it suggest a different strategy on
INFY_Q2_october_21_706 | managing your headcount?
INFY_Q2_october_21_707 | Pravin Rao
INFY_Q2_october_21_708 | There are a couple of things.
INFY_Q2_october_21_709 | One is, of course, in terms of talent availability, in terms of scale and
INFY_Q2_october_21_710 | quantity I do not think any other country can match that.
INFY_Q2_october_21_711 | So, from that extent, most of the noise
INFY_Q2_october_21_712 | and other things you are hearing are in India only.
INFY_Q2_october_21_713 | So that is one part of it, because I do not see
INFY_Q2_october_21_714 | any other country being able to provide such kind of talent with scale.
INFY_Q2_october_21_715 | So that is why we are seeing
INFY_Q2_october_21_716 | higher number.
INFY_Q2_october_21_717 | And the second one is, this is an unusual phenomenon.
INFY_Q2_october_21_718 | We have not seen this
INFY_Q2_october_21_719 | kind of war for talent for a long period of time and as I myself have been in the industry for over 35
INFY_Q2_october_21_720 | years, I cannot think of a time when we have seen this kind of situation.
INFY_Q2_october_21_721 | When we talk to people
INFY_Q2_october_21_722 | them when they are leaving, most of them are complimentary about Infosys, they talk highly about
INFY_Q2_october_21_723 | the culture, the kind of training, kind of opportunities they get and other things.
INFY_Q2_october_21_724 | But they are also
INFY_Q2_october_21_725 | saying, at the same time, the kind of compensation they are being offered is significantly higher.
INFY_Q2_october_21_726 | So today, despite all the HR interventions and other things, compensation seems to be a very big
INFY_Q2_october_21_727 | criteria and particularly for some of the companies who are just scaling up or who are setting up
INFY_Q2_october_21_728 | centers here, there are no options but to go aggressive on compensation to attract and get the
INFY_Q2_october_21_729 | talent.
INFY_Q2_october_21_730 | So, I would say that is the reason.
INFY_Q2_october_21_731 | And this is an unusual thing where some of your normal
INFY_Q2_october_21_732 | HR levers do not seem to work and people do acknowledge that they are happy otherwise, but the
INFY_Q2_october_21_733 | kind of offers they are getting is too attractive for them to refuse.
INFY_Q2_october_21_734 | These are all junior people, they
INFY_Q2_october_21_735 | are not emotionally fully connected with the company, whereas at the mid-level and senior-level,
INFY_Q2_october_21_736 | they are much more connected with the company.
INFY_Q2_october_21_737 | They understand the culture, they understand
INFY_Q2_october_21_738 | the industry and other things.
INFY_Q2_october_21_739 | So there, some of the HR practices work better.
INFY_Q2_october_21_740 | But at the junior
INFY_Q2_october_21_741 | level, while we try, what is out there is attractive and that becomes a challenge.
INFY_Q2_october_21_742 | Keith Bachman
INFY_Q2_october_21_743 | You mentioned a number of times that you do not see attrition improving over the next couple of
INFY_Q2_october_21_744 | quarters.
INFY_Q2_october_21_745 | But does your reported number get worse over the next couple of quarters just so we can
INFY_Q2_october_21_746 | manage investor expectations?
INFY_Q2_october_21_747 | Pravin Rao
INFY_Q2_october_21_748 | It will probably take a couple of quarters before attrition easing, because you have to onboard
INFY_Q2_october_21_749 | supply, you have to skill them, train them.
INFY_Q2_october_21_750 | So that will take some time before supply is available to
INFY_Q2_october_21_751 | be deployed in projects.
INFY_Q2_october_21_752 | So that is the time that will take before attrition eases.
INFY_Q2_october_21_753 | That is what I
INFY_Q2_october_21_754 | meant.
INFY_Q2_october_21_755 | Keith Bachman
INFY_Q2_october_21_756 | Does your reported attrition number get worse in, than the December and March quarters?
INFY_Q2_october_21_757 | Can
INFY_Q2_october_21_758 | attrition get worse before it gets better?
INFY_Q2_october_21_759 | Pravin Rao
INFY_Q2_october_21_760 | We hope that is not the case, but it is difficult to predict.
INFY_Q2_october_21_761 | But as I said earlier, so far we have been
INFY_Q2_october_21_762 | able to manage all the client expectations through hiring, through reskilling and through usage of
INFY_Q2_october_21_763 | subcontractors.
INFY_Q2_october_21_764 | So, at this stage, we are comfortable to meet all our planned commitments.
INFY_Q2_october_21_765 | Keith Bachman
INFY_Q2_october_21_766 | Many thanks and congratulations on solid results.
INFY_Q2_october_21_767 | Moderator
INFY_Q2_october_21_768 | Kawaljeet Saluja
INFY_Q2_october_21_769 | Pravin, I have learnt a lot from you and let us hope you stay in touch.
INFY_Q2_october_21_770 | I have a couple of questions,
INFY_Q2_october_21_771 | one for Pravin and one for Nilanjan.
INFY_Q2_october_21_772 | Nilanjan, for you the question is that you mentioned that the
INFY_Q2_october_21_773 | impact of wage increase is approximately 110 basis points and if I just do the back of the envelope
INFY_Q2_october_21_774 | math, your offshore wages, that percentage of revenue is 20%.
INFY_Q2_october_21_775 | So that equates to just a 5% wage
INFY_Q2_october_21_776 | increase effectively.
INFY_Q2_october_21_777 | Is that sufficient in the current environment?
INFY_Q2_october_21_778 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q2_october_21_779 | Couple of things, one is, of course, there were onsite and offshore both.
INFY_Q2_october_21_780 | There is a mix of that and
INFY_Q2_october_21_781 | it is only up to JL6’s.
INFY_Q2_october_21_782 | So, we planned for the senior and title holders in October.
INFY_Q2_october_21_783 | Also from October,
INFY_Q2_october_21_784 | we are rolling out more skill-based intervention compensation changes.
INFY_Q2_october_21_785 | So, as you know, this is
INFY_Q2_october_21_786 | something we did in January, then we have done something in July.
INFY_Q2_october_21_787 | And like I said, we are going
INFY_Q2_october_21_788 | to do something in October as well, not at the same level, but like I said, we need to do whatever
INFY_Q2_october_21_789 | is required to a) keep key talent back, and b) hire laterals as well, because as Pravin mentioned,
INFY_Q2_october_21_790 | even the cost of lateral goes up.
INFY_Q2_october_21_791 | I mean the churn is rotational in the industry.
INFY_Q2_october_21_792 | It is a zero-sum
INFY_Q2_october_21_793 | game; somebody else’s lateral is somebody else’s churn.
INFY_Q2_october_21_794 | So, we will do whatever is required to
INFY_Q2_october_21_795 | even onboard lateral and freshers.
INFY_Q2_october_21_796 | But at the end of the day, I think from an industry perspective, it
INFY_Q2_october_21_797 | is only once the freshers come in, can you really start seeing this thing really easing up.
INFY_Q2_october_21_798 | But we
INFY_Q2_october_21_799 | are quite comfortable in that sense in terms of our guidance, in terms of fulfilling what the clients
INFY_Q2_october_21_800 | are asking for and one of the ways is, of course, the subcon increase is not the best from a margin
INFY_Q2_october_21_801 | perspective, but you have seen our stats on subcon slightly going up just to fulfill that gap.
INFY_Q2_october_21_802 | Kawaljeet Saluja
INFY_Q2_october_21_803 | What will be the impact of wage revision, let us say, in December because that would be rolled out
INFY_Q2_october_21_804 | at a senior level?
INFY_Q2_october_21_805 | So, the impact of that would be a higher percentage offshore overall
INFY_Q2_october_21_806 | compensation number.
INFY_Q2_october_21_807 | So, what will be the impact of wage revision in December?
INFY_Q2_october_21_808 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q2_october_21_809 | So, we do not call out, but the overall wage impact of the senior level is definitely lower than I
INFY_Q2_october_21_810 | mean the headcount is a much, much smaller amount than what we have rolled out.
INFY_Q2_october_21_811 | But we
INFY_Q2_october_21_812 | cannot give a number of what is the margin impact.
INFY_Q2_october_21_813 | Kawaljeet Saluja
INFY_Q2_october_21_814 | The second question I had is for Pravin.
INFY_Q2_october_21_815 | Now, Pravin, we have been wired through your
INFY_Q2_october_21_816 | performance historically that whenever the attrition rates go up, your utilization rates go down.
INFY_Q2_october_21_817 | But
INFY_Q2_october_21_818 | this time around, they seem to be moving in the same direction, which is rather unusual.
INFY_Q2_october_21_819 | When do
INFY_Q2_october_21_820 | you think that this divergence really starts playing out the way, logically, it has done historically?
INFY_Q2_october_21_821 | Pravin Rao
INFY_Q2_october_21_822 | I am not sure about the correlation you are talking about because if attrition goes up the natural
INFY_Q2_october_21_823 | correlation would be utilization also improving, so there is a need to fulfillment, right?
INFY_Q2_october_21_824 | I mean you
INFY_Q2_october_21_825 | are talking about contrary, so I am not sure of the application.
INFY_Q2_october_21_826 | Kawaljeet Saluja
INFY_Q2_october_21_827 | But the logic is straightforward.
INFY_Q2_october_21_828 | Ultimately if the attrition is higher, normally you require greater
INFY_Q2_october_21_829 | project bench to fulfill customer demand and a high attrition environment also indicates a healthy
INFY_Q2_october_21_830 | growth environment, again which need a larger bench.
INFY_Q2_october_21_831 | So that was the logic behind that
INFY_Q2_october_21_832 | statement.
INFY_Q2_october_21_833 | Pravin Rao
INFY_Q2_october_21_834 | But anyway, in the current situation, there is no supply.
INFY_Q2_october_21_835 | As I said, you have to recruit people, train
INFY_Q2_october_21_836 | them and then deploy, that will take some time.
INFY_Q2_october_21_837 | You have to look at your existing people, re-skill
INFY_Q2_october_21_838 | them and deploy, that is the fastest thing for you to do.
INFY_Q2_october_21_839 | That means higher utilization and wherever
INFY_Q2_october_21_840 | there are gaps, we also look at subcons and we have seen increased subcons as well.
INFY_Q2_october_21_841 | So, the
INFY_Q2_october_21_842 | high utilization is definitely a function of lack of availability of talent, and we are recruiting as much
INFY_Q2_october_21_843 | as we can to meet the demands of our customers.
INFY_Q2_october_21_844 | Kawaljeet Saluja
INFY_Q2_october_21_845 | Okay, fantastic.

INFY_Q2_october_21_850 | Hi, congratulations on a great performance and all the best to Pravin.
INFY_Q2_october_21_851 | Two questions, the first
INFY_Q2_october_21_852 | question is to Nilanjan on margins.
INFY_Q2_october_21_853 | We just wanted to understand the puts and takes on margins in
INFY_Q2_october_21_854 | the second half.
INFY_Q2_october_21_855 | When we look at the various headwinds, there are continued rising attrition rates,
INFY_Q2_october_21_856 | higher travel expenses potentially; wage hike for a section of employees, full impact of the large
INFY_Q2_october_21_857 | deal ramp up, which is likely to take place in 3Q as well.
INFY_Q2_october_21_858 | So just trying to understand what are the
INFY_Q2_october_21_859 | tailwinds that can help to offset some of these impacts and keep the margin within the bag?
INFY_Q2_october_21_860 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q2_october_21_861 | We are going to have these headwinds, like you said on retention, on hiring, etc.
INFY_Q2_october_21_862 | But I think, like
INFY_Q2_october_21_863 | we demonstrated this quarter as well, we have a very strong cost optimization program also
INFY_Q2_october_21_864 | ongoing, automation, onsite offshore mix with broad basing of the pyramid, both onsite offshore.
INFY_Q2_october_21_865 | We are among the few companies who have these global DCs now in the West, where we can
INFY_Q2_october_21_866 | pump in freshers, right.
INFY_Q2_october_21_867 | So, I mean, we would not have had freshers in our onsite business, but
INFY_Q2_october_21_868 | now we are having more than 3,000-odd freshers a year in the onsite locations.
INFY_Q2_october_21_869 | So, this also helps
INFY_Q2_october_21_870 | in the pyramid.
INFY_Q2_october_21_871 | And as you know, 75% of our people cost is onsite.
INFY_Q2_october_21_872 | So, unless we really address
INFY_Q2_october_21_873 | onsite costs, you cannot really make an impact on the overall cost structure.
INFY_Q2_october_21_874 | So, all this is going
INFY_Q2_october_21_875 | on.
INFY_Q2_october_21_876 | We are also looking at pricing much more holistically at this time, although it is not easy to go
INFY_Q2_october_21_877 | and get price hikes just on the basis of a rate card.
INFY_Q2_october_21_878 | But basically, we are working with our sales
INFY_Q2_october_21_879 | force on how to sell on value, how to sell on more innovative commercial constructs and the idea
INFY_Q2_october_21_880 | is not to leave those cents and pennies on the table in this market, be a bit bolder in terms of
INFY_Q2_october_21_881 | pricing.
INFY_Q2_october_21_882 | But this is a long haul, if there is any time to start something on this, it is now.

INFY_Q2_october_21_884 | My second question is to Salil with respect to visibility.
INFY_Q2_october_21_885 | As we enter calendar 2022, is it fair to say
INFY_Q2_october_21_886 | that when we entered calendar 2021, the visibility was higher than usual, given the large amount
INFY_Q2_october_21_887 | of the new deals already in the bag, which may not necessarily be the case as we get into the
INFY_Q2_october_21_888 | calendar 2022?
INFY_Q2_october_21_889 | So, is it fair to say that the visibility will be relatively lower than calendar 2021,
INFY_Q2_october_21_890 | which was at a high and elevated level?
INFY_Q2_october_21_891 | Thank you.
INFY_Q2_october_21_892 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q2_october_21_893 | I think the way we see our business; we look at it from the financial year perspective.
INFY_Q2_october_21_894 | When we
INFY_Q2_october_21_895 | started this financial year, you will recall the COVID situation was in all the geographies and while
INFY_Q2_october_21_896 | we had a healthy pipeline because of the digital work, that was always something of an overhang
INFY_Q2_october_21_897 | that was there.
INFY_Q2_october_21_898 | Then you have seen that from our initial guidance, we increased the guidance last
INFY_Q2_october_21_899 | quarter.
INFY_Q2_october_21_900 | We have now further increased the guidance this quarter.
INFY_Q2_october_21_901 | So, we have extremely good
INFY_Q2_october_21_902 | visibility for this financial year with the guidance we have given.
INFY_Q2_october_21_903 | As we finish Q3 and start to get
INFY_Q2_october_21_904 | into Q4, we will start to have a good idea of what the following financial year will look like.
INFY_Q2_october_21_905 | My own
INFY_Q2_october_21_906 | sense is the demand that we have is quite comprehensive and that will certainly continue to help
INFY_Q2_october_21_907 | us as long as we build out the new capabilities well and be part of the clients’ digital and cloud
INFY_Q2_october_21_908 | journey.
INFY_Q2_october_21_909 | So, the increase in guidance gives us more confidence now for this financial year.

INFY_Q2_october_21_911 | Thank you.
INFY_Q2_october_21_912 | Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today.
INFY_Q2_october_21_913 | I now hand the conference
INFY_Q2_october_21_914 | over to the management for closing comments.
INFY_Q2_october_21_915 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q2_october_21_916 | Thank you, everyone.
INFY_Q2_october_21_917 | So, I will just spend a couple of minutes in closing.
INFY_Q2_october_21_918 | First, we have had the best quarter in terms of growth, 19.4% highest that we have had in 11
INFY_Q2_october_21_919 | years.
INFY_Q2_october_21_920 | So, we are extremely delighted with that outcome.
INFY_Q2_october_21_921 | The demand is strong.
INFY_Q2_october_21_922 | There are
INFY_Q2_october_21_923 | multiple components of demand.
INFY_Q2_october_21_924 | One is large deals, which is still looking good with the pipeline we
INFY_Q2_october_21_925 | have, including the $2 bn that we have secured in this quarter.
INFY_Q2_october_21_926 | There is a huge amount of existing
INFY_Q2_october_21_927 | client base that we have, where we see incredible demand.
INFY_Q2_october_21_928 | This does not always come into the
INFY_Q2_october_21_929 | large deals bucket.
INFY_Q2_october_21_930 | It will be in different sizes, some are large, and some are not.
INFY_Q2_october_21_931 | But a client that I
INFY_Q2_october_21_932 | talked to last week in a meeting with the CIO, we were looking at multiple thousand people
INFY_Q2_october_21_933 | expansion at a client where we already have an account base of over a $100 mn today.
INFY_Q2_october_21_934 | Then we
INFY_Q2_october_21_935 | see the capability set and the demand in digital and cloud.
INFY_Q2_october_21_936 | Clients are extremely thrilled with our
INFY_Q2_october_21_937 | capabilities and we see good traction in that.
INFY_Q2_october_21_938 | Second, the operating efficiency is strong.
INFY_Q2_october_21_939 | The margin resilience that we talked about; we have
INFY_Q2_october_21_940 | done really well there.
INFY_Q2_october_21_941 | Of course, as Nilanjan mentioned, we do see some additional cost that will
INFY_Q2_october_21_942 | come; and we are comfortable with our margin guidance that we have given.
INFY_Q2_october_21_943 | Third, we talked a lot, Pravin gave a lot of detail – we are expanding our supply capacity that we
INFY_Q2_october_21_944 | are taking in and that is the medium-term play that we have because the demand is long term; and
INFY_Q2_october_21_945 | we will make sure the supply – with our incredible brand and training will continue.
INFY_Q2_october_21_946 | Fourth, we have increased our guidance.
INFY_Q2_october_21_947 | So, we are extremely optimistic and bullish with 16.5% to
INFY_Q2_october_21_948 | 17.5% on growth and overall, I personally remain positive about the future in our tech services
INFY_Q2_october_21_949 | business growing at 18% today.
