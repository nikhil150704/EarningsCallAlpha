INFY_Q1_July_22_14 | Hello everyone and welcome to Infosys Earnings Call to discuss Q1 2023 Financial Results.
INFY_Q1_July_22_15 | This
INFY_Q1_July_22_16 | is Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in Bangalore.
INFY_Q1_July_22_17 | Joining us today on this call is CEO
INFY_Q1_July_22_18 | and MD, Mr. Salil Parekh; CFO, Mr. Nilanjan Roy; and other members of the senior management
INFY_Q1_July_22_19 | team.

INFY_Q1_July_22_21 | and Nilanjan.
INFY_Q1_July_22_22 | Subsequent to which, we will open up the call for questions.
INFY_Q1_July_22_23 | Please note that anything that we say that refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking

INFY_Q1_July_22_28 | I would now like to pass on the call to Salil.
INFY_Q1_July_22_29 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q1_July_22_30 | Thanks, Sandeep.
INFY_Q1_July_22_31 | Good morning and good evening to everyone on the call.
INFY_Q1_July_22_32 | Thank you all for
INFY_Q1_July_22_33 | taking the time to join us.
INFY_Q1_July_22_34 | We had an excellent start to the financial year with 5.5% sequential growth and 21.4% year-on-
INFY_Q1_July_22_35 | year growth in constant currency terms.
INFY_Q1_July_22_36 | We continue to gain market share with our Cobalt cloud capabilities and our differentiated digital
INFY_Q1_July_22_37 | value proposition driving a significant pipeline of opportunities for us.
INFY_Q1_July_22_38 | For example a premier online retailer in the U.S. leveraged Infosys Cobalt to embark on a cloud-
INFY_Q1_July_22_39 | driven transformation journey to enhance the customer experience and improve their security
INFY_Q1_July_22_40 | posture.
INFY_Q1_July_22_41 | Another example is European manufacturer who is reimagining their Digital workplace with best-
INFY_Q1_July_22_42 | of-breed network security and IT infrastructure powered by Infosys Cobalt.
INFY_Q1_July_22_43 | There are examples like this all across the spectrum in different sectors and that are driving
INFY_Q1_July_22_44 | Infosys Cobalt into the market.
INFY_Q1_July_22_45 | Clients continue to place an immense amount of trust and confidence in Infosys to help accelerate
INFY_Q1_July_22_46 | their digital transformation agenda, both on efficiency and the growth dimension of their business.
INFY_Q1_July_22_47 | The strong growth we have seen in the quarter lays a robust foundation for the year.
INFY_Q1_July_22_48 | Growth continues to remain broad-based across the segments, service lines and geographies.
INFY_Q1_July_22_49 | Each of our business segments grew in double-digits with several of them growing at 25% or
INFY_Q1_July_22_50 | higher.
INFY_Q1_July_22_51 | In terms of geography the U.S. geography grew at 18.4% and Europe grew at 33.2%.
INFY_Q1_July_22_52 | This
INFY_Q1_July_22_53 | indicates a healthy demand environment and is a reflection of how our industry-leading digital
INFY_Q1_July_22_54 | capabilities are relevant for our clients.
INFY_Q1_July_22_55 | Our Digital revenues were 61% of the total and grew at 37.5% in the quarter in constant currency
INFY_Q1_July_22_56 | terms.
INFY_Q1_July_22_57 | Within digital, our cloud work continues to grow faster, with our Cobalt cloud capability
INFY_Q1_July_22_58 | seeing significant traction with our clients.
INFY_Q1_July_22_59 | Our overall pipeline remains strong.
INFY_Q1_July_22_60 | We do see pockets of weakness, for example in the area of
INFY_Q1_July_22_61 | mortgages in Financial Services.
INFY_Q1_July_22_62 | We keep a close watch on the evolving macro environment in
INFY_Q1_July_22_63 | terms of the changes to the pipeline.
INFY_Q1_July_22_64 | Within our pipeline, we also have focus in addition to the
INFY_Q1_July_22_65 | growth areas in digital and cloud to the cost areas through automation and AI.
INFY_Q1_July_22_66 | Our operating margins were at 20%.
INFY_Q1_July_22_67 | We have completed the majority of our compensation review
INFY_Q1_July_22_68 | for this year.
INFY_Q1_July_22_69 | Nilanjan, will also provide more details on the overall margin update.
INFY_Q1_July_22_70 | Some other highlights of our results are
INFY_Q1_July_22_71 | -
INFY_Q1_July_22_72 | We signed 19 large deals with a TCV of $1.69 bn.
INFY_Q1_July_22_73 | This is comprises of 50% net new work
INFY_Q1_July_22_74 | -
INFY_Q1_July_22_75 | Our onsite mix was at 24.3%
INFY_Q1_July_22_76 | -
INFY_Q1_July_22_77 | As we build capacity for the future, our utilization was at healthy levels of 84.7%
INFY_Q1_July_22_78 | -
INFY_Q1_July_22_79 | Our free cash flow was strong at $656 mn
INFY_Q1_July_22_80 | -
INFY_Q1_July_22_81 | Our quarterly attrition declined.
INFY_Q1_July_22_82 | Historically, Q1 attrition increases by three to four
INFY_Q1_July_22_83 | percentage points sequentially on a quarterly annualized basis; however, our attrition
INFY_Q1_July_22_84 | declined by one percentage point on a sequential basis - reflecting the impact of various
INFY_Q1_July_22_85 | initiatives we have put in place
INFY_Q1_July_22_86 | -
INFY_Q1_July_22_87 | We had a net headcount increase of over 21,000 employees attracting leading talent from
INFY_Q1_July_22_88 | the market, which is a reflection of our enhanced recruitment capabilities, solid brand and
INFY_Q1_July_22_89 | deeper penetration into various talent markets.
INFY_Q1_July_22_90 | Our Cobalt Cloud capability continues to be market leading.
INFY_Q1_July_22_91 | We have 360 technology and domain
INFY_Q1_July_22_92 | solutions, five of our assets have over 50 clients each, we have 150 industry focused solutions, 20
INFY_Q1_July_22_93 | Infosys living labs, 50 experimentation programs, and 60,000 knowledge assets.
INFY_Q1_July_22_94 | Our ‘One Infosys’ approach is serving us well to bring the best of Infosys and service to our client’s
INFY_Q1_July_22_95 | needs.
INFY_Q1_July_22_96 | Earlier this month we announced the acquisition of BASE Life Sciences, a Denmark-based
INFY_Q1_July_22_97 | technology and consulting firm in the life sciences industry.
INFY_Q1_July_22_98 | BASE brings to Infosys domain
INFY_Q1_July_22_99 | expertise in medical, digital marketing, clinical and regulatory areas.
INFY_Q1_July_22_100 | With our strong growth in Q1 and our current outlook on demand opportunity and pipeline, we
INFY_Q1_July_22_101 | increase our revenue growth guidance which was at 13% to 15%, now to 14% to 16% for the full
INFY_Q1_July_22_102 | year.
INFY_Q1_July_22_103 | We keep our margin guidance at 21% to 23%.
INFY_Q1_July_22_104 | With the increased cost environment, we will
INFY_Q1_July_22_105 | be at the lower end of this margin guidance.
INFY_Q1_July_22_106 | Thank you and with that let me hand it over to Nilanjan for his update.
INFY_Q1_July_22_107 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_108 | morning.
INFY_Q1_July_22_109 | We had a strong start of FY2023 with a robust year-on-year growth of 21.4% in constant currency.
INFY_Q1_July_22_110 | All our business segments and major geos recorded double-digit growth with manufacturing,
INFY_Q1_July_22_111 | communication and EURS along with Europe region recording 25% plus growth.
INFY_Q1_July_22_112 | Sequentially, revenue growth was 5.5% which was led by a healthy volume growth and some RPP
INFY_Q1_July_22_113 | benefits.
INFY_Q1_July_22_114 | Digital revenues now constitute 61% of total and grew by 37.5% in constant currency.
INFY_Q1_July_22_115 | Client metrics were strong with increase in client counts across revenue buckets compared to the
INFY_Q1_July_22_116 | previous year.
INFY_Q1_July_22_117 | Number of $50 mn clients increased by 10 to 69 creating the next potential
INFY_Q1_July_22_118 | centurions.
INFY_Q1_July_22_119 | Number of $100 mn clients increased by 4 to 38 and the number of $200 mn clients
INFY_Q1_July_22_120 | have grown by 6 in the last one year.
INFY_Q1_July_22_121 | This reflects our ability to deepen mining across our large
INFY_Q1_July_22_122 | clients.
INFY_Q1_July_22_123 | We had another quarter of strong employee additions with over 21,000 to cater to the growth
INFY_Q1_July_22_124 | opportunities ahead.
INFY_Q1_July_22_125 | The fresher addition was particularly strong which resulted in drop in
INFY_Q1_July_22_126 | utilization to 84.7%.
INFY_Q1_July_22_127 | Onsite effort mix inched up to 24.3%.
INFY_Q1_July_22_128 | Voluntary LTM attrition increased
INFY_Q1_July_22_129 | marginally to 28.4%.
INFY_Q1_July_22_130 | Quarterly annualized attrition declined another by 1% from Q4 levels despite
INFY_Q1_July_22_131 | Q1 usually seeing an uptick due to seasonality.
INFY_Q1_July_22_132 | As announced earlier we have given competitive salary increases for majority of employees from
INFY_Q1_July_22_133 | April.
INFY_Q1_July_22_134 | Given the supply tightness and high prevailing inflation, salary increases across all geos this
INFY_Q1_July_22_135 | year are higher than historical levels.
INFY_Q1_July_22_136 | The increases vary based on job levels and performance of
INFY_Q1_July_22_137 | employees with top performers getting double-digit hikes.
INFY_Q1_July_22_138 | Salary hike for other employees is being
INFY_Q1_July_22_139 | done effective 1st July.
INFY_Q1_July_22_140 | Q1 margin stood at 20%, a drop of 150 basis points versus previous quarter.
INFY_Q1_July_22_141 | The major
INFY_Q1_July_22_142 | components of the sequential margin movements were as below:
INFY_Q1_July_22_143 | Headwinds of
INFY_Q1_July_22_144 | -
INFY_Q1_July_22_145 | 1.6% due to salary increases,
INFY_Q1_July_22_146 | -
INFY_Q1_July_22_147 | 0.4% due to drop in utilization as we create capacity for future,
INFY_Q1_July_22_148 | -
INFY_Q1_July_22_149 | 0.3% due to increases in subcon, third party and other costs.
INFY_Q1_July_22_150 | These were offset by tailwinds of
INFY_Q1_July_22_151 | -
INFY_Q1_July_22_152 | 0.5% due to increase in RPP from higher working days, a reversal of a client's contractual
INFY_Q1_July_22_153 | provision in our FS segment partially offset by discounts.
INFY_Q1_July_22_154 | -
INFY_Q1_July_22_155 | 0.3% benefits from rupee depreciation benefits partially offset by cross-currency
INFY_Q1_July_22_156 | headwinds.
INFY_Q1_July_22_157 | Q1 EPS grew by 4.4% in rupee terms on a year-on-year basis.
INFY_Q1_July_22_158 | Our balance sheet continues to be strong and debt-free.
INFY_Q1_July_22_159 | Consolidated cash and investments were
INFY_Q1_July_22_160 | 4.4 bn at the end of the quarter after returning more than $850 mn to the shareholders through
INFY_Q1_July_22_161 | dividends.
INFY_Q1_July_22_162 | This has led to increase in ROE to 31%.
INFY_Q1_July_22_163 | Free cash flow for the quarter was $656 mn which is a conversion of 95% of net profits.
INFY_Q1_July_22_164 | Yield on
INFY_Q1_July_22_165 | cash balance remained stable at 5.3% in Q1.
INFY_Q1_July_22_166 | DSO declined by 4 days sequentially to 63.
INFY_Q1_July_22_167 | DSO
INFY_Q1_July_22_168 | including net unbilled was 82 days an increase of 1 day versus Q4.
INFY_Q1_July_22_169 | Coming to segmental performance:
INFY_Q1_July_22_170 | We signed 19 large deals in Q1 with a TCV of $1.69 bn.
INFY_Q1_July_22_171 | This comprises of the 50% net new.
INFY_Q1_July_22_172 | We
INFY_Q1_July_22_173 | have signed 5 large deals in retail and CPG, 4 in Hi-Tech, 3 each in financial services and energy
INFY_Q1_July_22_174 | utility resources and services and 2 each in manufacturing and communications verticals.
INFY_Q1_July_22_175 | Region-
INFY_Q1_July_22_176 | wise 15 were in Americas and 2 each in Europe and RoW.
INFY_Q1_July_22_177 | In Financial Services clients continue to focus on digital customer experience, contact center
INFY_Q1_July_22_178 | transformation and virtual branches aimed at improving customer engagement.
INFY_Q1_July_22_179 | While the order
INFY_Q1_July_22_180 | pipeline remains strong across regions, we are seeing some slowness in mortgage industry and
INFY_Q1_July_22_181 | lending business due to increased interest rates.
INFY_Q1_July_22_182 | We remain watchful of impacts of emerging
INFY_Q1_July_22_183 | global developments on budget for clients.
INFY_Q1_July_22_184 | In the retail segment the pace of Digital transformation large-scale cost breakouts and improving
INFY_Q1_July_22_185 | business resilience continues to be on the rise across various subsegments.
INFY_Q1_July_22_186 | Our focus on
INFY_Q1_July_22_187 | proactive engagement has helped us in creating a robust pipeline.
INFY_Q1_July_22_188 | Clients are monitoring the
INFY_Q1_July_22_189 | emerging macro situation and the impact of that on their business.
INFY_Q1_July_22_190 | In communications segment clients are focused on rapid digitization and protecting their assets
INFY_Q1_July_22_191 | from cyber threats, we see enormous potential to partner with them both on the digital
INFY_Q1_July_22_192 | transformation agenda as well as in the cost takeout front.
INFY_Q1_July_22_193 | Deal pipeline in energies, utilities, resources and services segments comprises of opportunities
INFY_Q1_July_22_194 | around cost takeouts, vendor consolidation, digital transformation, cloud-led transformation and
INFY_Q1_July_22_195 | asset monetization across industry sub-verticals.
INFY_Q1_July_22_196 | Manufacturing segment is seeing broad-based growth across geographies and industry sub-
INFY_Q1_July_22_197 | verticals.
INFY_Q1_July_22_198 | The sector has seen traction across energy, IoT, supply chain, cloud ERP and
INFY_Q1_July_22_199 | accelerated cloud adoption.
INFY_Q1_July_22_200 | In Q1 we have been ranked as leader in 9 ratings in the areas of Oracle Cloud, SAP S/4HANA,
INFY_Q1_July_22_201 | Public Cloud, Industry 4.0, employee experience and automation services.
INFY_Q1_July_22_202 | In this supply constrained environment, we continue to invest in our growth momentum which
INFY_Q1_July_22_203 | requires us to hire premium, skill talent while simultaneously investing in existing employees
INFY_Q1_July_22_204 | through competitive compensation increases across geos.
INFY_Q1_July_22_205 | Additionally, we expect normalization of
INFY_Q1_July_22_206 | costs like travel and other overheads.
INFY_Q1_July_22_207 | We will continue to focus on various cost optimization
INFY_Q1_July_22_208 | measures including rationalization of subcons, flattening of the pyramid, increasing automation,
INFY_Q1_July_22_209 | reducing onsite mix and increasing pricing.
INFY_Q1_July_22_210 | Whilst we retain our operating margin guidance of 21% to 23%, we expect to be at the bottom end
INFY_Q1_July_22_211 | of the range.
INFY_Q1_July_22_212 | The revenue guidance for the year has been revised to 14% to 16% from 13% to
INFY_Q1_July_22_213 | 15% earlier.
INFY_Q1_July_22_214 | With that we can open the call for questions.
INFY_Q1_July_22_215 | Moderator
INFY_Q1_July_22_216 | Thank you very much.
INFY_Q1_July_22_217 | Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session.
INFY_Q1_July_22_218 | Our first question is from the line of Surendra Goyal from Citi Group.
INFY_Q1_July_22_219 | Please go ahead.
INFY_Q1_July_22_220 | Surendra Goyal
INFY_Q1_July_22_221 | Thanks for that.
INFY_Q1_July_22_222 | Good morning just a couple of questions from my side.
INFY_Q1_July_22_223 | Firstly a clarification.
INFY_Q1_July_22_224 | Nilanjan, I believe you said that the contractual provision was largely offset by discounts.
INFY_Q1_July_22_225 | Could
INFY_Q1_July_22_226 | you please clarify a bit.
INFY_Q1_July_22_227 | Did you mean discounts to the same client or discounts in general?
INFY_Q1_July_22_228 | Curious because on one hand we are talking of a strong demand environment and potential price
INFY_Q1_July_22_229 | hikes and at the same time we are also talking of discounts?
INFY_Q1_July_22_230 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_231 | The comment was 0.5% increase in RPP is a combination of three to four elements – higher
INFY_Q1_July_22_232 | working days, the client contraction provision reversal benefits partially offset by discount.
INFY_Q1_July_22_233 | So it is
INFY_Q1_July_22_234 | not a direct linkage of discounts and client contractual provisions.
INFY_Q1_July_22_235 | It is not to the same client.
INFY_Q1_July_22_236 | These are generic discounts and these automatically keep on coming.
INFY_Q1_July_22_237 | But, like I said discounts
INFY_Q1_July_22_238 | have come down as we have started negotiating with our clients in terms of pricing but that is the
INFY_Q1_July_22_239 | net impact of all these.
INFY_Q1_July_22_240 | Surendra Goyal
INFY_Q1_July_22_241 | Just another question on margin down 360 bps year-over-year, operating profit growth Y-o-Y is
INFY_Q1_July_22_242 | worse in historical trends despite all the strong demand and growth we are talking about.
INFY_Q1_July_22_243 | So if you
INFY_Q1_July_22_244 | just think about this 360 basis point decline, how much of that is really investment which you think
INFY_Q1_July_22_245 | can be recouped as we go forward from here?
INFY_Q1_July_22_246 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_247 | When we were 360 bps down, we knew we were having some benefits in a way - our utilization
INFY_Q1_July_22_248 | was very high it was 88%, we have never operated at that level before, the benefits of travel etc.
INFY_Q1_July_22_249 | Now we are seeing more and more of that has been coming back.
INFY_Q1_July_22_250 | So that is something which we
INFY_Q1_July_22_251 | were well aware of in last year.
INFY_Q1_July_22_252 | But as we see the demand volume ahead, I think we are very clear
INFY_Q1_July_22_253 | that in terms of our ability to support this demand first we have to hire, we have to pay
INFY_Q1_July_22_254 | competitively.
INFY_Q1_July_22_255 | So we actually did two wage hikes in calendar year 2021 and now this year we have
INFY_Q1_July_22_256 | already rolled out in April.
INFY_Q1_July_22_257 | So within one and a half year we have done three substantial CRs and
INFY_Q1_July_22_258 | actually in September last year also we did a skill based increase.
INFY_Q1_July_22_259 | So we have been continuously
INFY_Q1_July_22_260 | investing behind that and we know that to capitalize this demand we have to pay for premium
INFY_Q1_July_22_261 | skills.
INFY_Q1_July_22_262 | We have to go behind the volume.
INFY_Q1_July_22_263 | Comparing subcontractor costs - perhaps from an
INFY_Q1_July_22_264 | industry leading 6.5% position we are closer to 11% now, but again these are something we know
INFY_Q1_July_22_265 | over a period of time we have a lot of optimization levers.
INFY_Q1_July_22_266 | We do not want to leave a five-year
INFY_Q1_July_22_267 | demand on the table because of short-term cost pressures and these we can optimize over this
INFY_Q1_July_22_268 | year and over the future as well.
INFY_Q1_July_22_269 | So in that sense we are quite confident and that is why we have
INFY_Q1_July_22_270 | talked about 21% to 23% range and we will be at the bottom end of the range.
INFY_Q1_July_22_271 | Of course if we are
INFY_Q1_July_22_272 | 20% today, we will see that improvement as the year progresses.
INFY_Q1_July_22_273 | Surendra Goyal
INFY_Q1_July_22_274 | Sure thanks for that I will get back in the queue.
INFY_Q1_July_22_275 | Moderator
INFY_Q1_July_22_276 | ahead.
INFY_Q1_July_22_277 | Moshe Katri
INFY_Q1_July_22_278 | Thanks.
INFY_Q1_July_22_279 | Spectacular numbers especially on revenues side of the business.
INFY_Q1_July_22_280 | Just a follow-up to the
INFY_Q1_July_22_281 | last topic or question about margins.
INFY_Q1_July_22_282 | We are getting a lot of pushbacks on that.
INFY_Q1_July_22_283 | From your
INFY_Q1_July_22_284 | perspective looking at the levers that you highlighted, what do you think is the biggest potential
INFY_Q1_July_22_285 | lever here for you to be able to catch up to the margin range that you mentioned and then I have a
INFY_Q1_July_22_286 | follow-up after that.
INFY_Q1_July_22_287 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_288 | Firstly if you see, how our margin profile, has changed, so one, of course has been this utilization
INFY_Q1_July_22_289 | and in fact, 21,000+ net adds during the quarter which is well above our volumes and that is to
INFY_Q1_July_22_290 | create the buffer.
INFY_Q1_July_22_291 | So when we put in freshers, we train them and then over a period of time, we are
INFY_Q1_July_22_292 | able to put them into production.
INFY_Q1_July_22_293 | So you cannot just have higher freshers and expect them to start
INFY_Q1_July_22_294 | contributing from day 1.
INFY_Q1_July_22_295 | We are very vigilant about that.
INFY_Q1_July_22_296 | They go through mandatory training in
INFY_Q1_July_22_297 | Myosre, and then we put them into projects.
INFY_Q1_July_22_298 | So that is one big part of where we think we can start
INFY_Q1_July_22_299 | improving.
INFY_Q1_July_22_300 | As the hiring catches up automatically, you will see the stabilization of subcon costs,
INFY_Q1_July_22_301 | which as percentage of revenue, you are seeing this increase every quarter.
INFY_Q1_July_22_302 | While we have seen it
INFY_Q1_July_22_303 | flattening out and over the future, as we got our recruitments done and we are able to hire fresher,
INFY_Q1_July_22_304 | we should see benefits coming out of that.
INFY_Q1_July_22_305 | Pyramid benefits will continue to happen for us.
INFY_Q1_July_22_306 | While we are seeing some adverse impact from
INFY_Q1_July_22_307 | the onsite movement, this is largely as travel overseas starts, but we think this is more of a
INFY_Q1_July_22_308 | aberration in terms of uptick, because the inherent story of taking cost out and having a more
INFY_Q1_July_22_309 | offshore mix in the entire cost optimization will come into benefits especially in this environment
INFY_Q1_July_22_310 | where cost take out is becoming a big theme across our clients.
INFY_Q1_July_22_311 | So, we know we can have
INFY_Q1_July_22_312 | multiple areas.
INFY_Q1_July_22_313 | Pricing is another thing, which we have been talking about.
INFY_Q1_July_22_314 | We have seen less impact of
INFY_Q1_July_22_315 | discounts, etc., we are going back to clients in terms of COLA adjustments at the time of renewals.
INFY_Q1_July_22_316 | Now these are much more longer-term impact decisions, but I think at least the conversations
INFY_Q1_July_22_317 | have started in right direction across all the segments and you can hear similar commentary
INFY_Q1_July_22_318 | across.
INFY_Q1_July_22_319 | So I think these are the areas we continue to focus on and are something we have done
INFY_Q1_July_22_320 | over the years.
INFY_Q1_July_22_321 | We continue to be very forceful in terms of our cost efficiency exercises.
INFY_Q1_July_22_322 | Moshe Katri
INFY_Q1_July_22_323 | Just as a follow-up, just remind us what is the sensitivity for margins versus utilization rates i.e.,
INFY_Q1_July_22_324 | 100 basis points expansion in utilization rates what does it mean to margins in terms of sensitivity?
INFY_Q1_July_22_325 | Thank you.
INFY_Q1_July_22_326 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_327 | Yes, so I think it depends on by which levels we see utilization.
INFY_Q1_July_22_328 | So, it is quite complicated if you
INFY_Q1_July_22_329 | have a different utilization in onsite, different in offshore and then the impact of the freshers in the
INFY_Q1_July_22_330 | pyramid in that utilization.
INFY_Q1_July_22_331 | So, it is a bit complicated how the mix changes.
INFY_Q1_July_22_332 | I just cannot give you off
INFY_Q1_July_22_333 | the cuff number of what 1% will lead to, but to give you the impact in this quarter, 40 basis points
INFY_Q1_July_22_334 | because of utilization on margins.
INFY_Q1_July_22_335 | Moshe Katri
INFY_Q1_July_22_336 | All right thanks for the color.

INFY_Q1_July_22_339 | Kumar Rakesh
INFY_Q1_July_22_340 | Good morning.
INFY_Q1_July_22_341 | Thank you for taking my question.
INFY_Q1_July_22_342 | My first question was continuation on the margin
INFY_Q1_July_22_343 | side.
INFY_Q1_July_22_344 | At the end of the fourth quarter, and not just Infosys but across the industry what the
INFY_Q1_July_22_345 | management commentary had indicated compared to that the margin performance appears to be
INFY_Q1_July_22_346 | a sharper decline.
INFY_Q1_July_22_347 | Now Salil what do you think could be the reason behind that?
INFY_Q1_July_22_348 | Is it driven by
INFY_Q1_July_22_349 | higher than expected demand and higher use of subcontracting than what you are planning early
INFY_Q1_July_22_350 | or is it more supply side driven that the fresher was higher than what we had planned for through
INFY_Q1_July_22_351 | the quarter?
INFY_Q1_July_22_352 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_353 | Are you talking about us in particular about the industry?
INFY_Q1_July_22_354 | Kumar Rakesh
INFY_Q1_July_22_355 | Anything whatever you could give us color on because the trend has been very similar to yourself.
INFY_Q1_July_22_356 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_357 | Yes, so we do not operate in a vacuum and this industry also does not operate in a vacuum.
INFY_Q1_July_22_358 | The
INFY_Q1_July_22_359 | attrition trends are pretty much similar across industries but the good news, like you said is that
INFY_Q1_July_22_360 | attrition is coming down.
INFY_Q1_July_22_361 | Our quarter attrition figure is actually below our LTM figures and as Salil
INFY_Q1_July_22_362 | said we are 1% down on a sequential basis, we were 5% down in the previous quarter and we
INFY_Q1_July_22_363 | were flat the earlier quarter.
INFY_Q1_July_22_364 | The reported LTM is more of a catch-up effect and in that sense you
INFY_Q1_July_22_365 | will see stabilization.
INFY_Q1_July_22_366 | The freshers will start coming in and getting permeated.
INFY_Q1_July_22_367 | So that benefit in a
INFY_Q1_July_22_368 | way should start creeping into the cost structure because at the end of the day if you are putting
INFY_Q1_July_22_369 | freshers we have less attrition, the fresh hikes which you have to give for lateral hirers should
INFY_Q1_July_22_370 | come down, joining bonuses impact should come down.
INFY_Q1_July_22_371 | So these are the things which can play in
INFY_Q1_July_22_372 | our favour.
INFY_Q1_July_22_373 | You have seen these numbers of decline pretty much across industries.
INFY_Q1_July_22_374 | I think we
INFY_Q1_July_22_375 | have a very, very sharp cost optimization program in a way which will go and offset these
INFY_Q1_July_22_376 | headwinds.
INFY_Q1_July_22_377 | Kumar Rakesh
INFY_Q1_July_22_378 | Got it.
INFY_Q1_July_22_379 | So it appears the supply side pressure was higher than what we were earlier expecting.
INFY_Q1_July_22_380 | My
INFY_Q1_July_22_381 | second question was on the acquisition.
INFY_Q1_July_22_382 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_383 | I think there is no question about that.
INFY_Q1_July_22_384 | You see our attrition and the net adds, the gross hiring has
INFY_Q1_July_22_385 | been very well and of course in that sense in terms of our stretches and all we have to offer.
INFY_Q1_July_22_386 | So it
INFY_Q1_July_22_387 | is an overall industry issues led from the demand side.
INFY_Q1_July_22_388 | Kumar Rakesh
INFY_Q1_July_22_389 | Thanks.
INFY_Q1_July_22_390 | My second question was on BASE acquisition.
INFY_Q1_July_22_391 | So we already have a pretty strong life
INFY_Q1_July_22_392 | sciences practice with more than $1 bn scale, so what exactly we are looking and targeting to get
INFY_Q1_July_22_393 | help from this acquisition?
INFY_Q1_July_22_394 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q1_July_22_395 | On BASE there are multiple things.
INFY_Q1_July_22_396 | This is a business which is very high end in the life sciences
INFY_Q1_July_22_397 | area.
INFY_Q1_July_22_398 | When we launched our strategy a few weeks ago just at the start of the quarter we had
INFY_Q1_July_22_399 | shared also a new focus or an expanded focus on Europe.
INFY_Q1_July_22_400 | Denmark for us is a very strategic
INFY_Q1_July_22_401 | market, the whole Scandinavian market is a very strategic market for us.
INFY_Q1_July_22_402 | So that is the second
INFY_Q1_July_22_403 | area that it benefits us.
INFY_Q1_July_22_404 | We also see clients are using the capabilities of BASE as a starting point
INFY_Q1_July_22_405 | and then that leads to large technology transformation, digital transformation and that helps us
INFY_Q1_July_22_406 | overall in terms of scaling up that segment.
INFY_Q1_July_22_407 | That is a segment which we feel is a strong segment
INFY_Q1_July_22_408 | for the future and where in our view underweight in percentage terms.
INFY_Q1_July_22_409 | So we want to enhance that
INFY_Q1_July_22_410 | with these existing capabilities.
INFY_Q1_July_22_411 | Kumar Rakesh
INFY_Q1_July_22_412 | Got it thanks a lot for that Salil.
INFY_Q1_July_22_413 | Moderator
INFY_Q1_July_22_414 | Keith Bachman
INFY_Q1_July_22_415 | Thank you very much.
INFY_Q1_July_22_416 | My first question is I wanted to get your views on how you think wage
INFY_Q1_July_22_417 | inflation will impact the balance of the year.
INFY_Q1_July_22_418 | And what are the tensions on that to your margin
INFY_Q1_July_22_419 | model?
INFY_Q1_July_22_420 | So you mentioned that attrition has in fact moved lower, do you think attrition continues to
INFY_Q1_July_22_421 | move lower and how do you think wage inflation will unfold over the next about three, four quarters
INFY_Q1_July_22_422 | and be a force in the gross margin equation and then will follow up?
INFY_Q1_July_22_423 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_424 | I think like we started last year we were very clear that we have to be competitive in the market.
INFY_Q1_July_22_425 | So, we did the first hike in January of 2021 then we did the next hike in July of 2021 then we did a
INFY_Q1_July_22_426 | follow-up on our talent in September of 2021.
INFY_Q1_July_22_427 | In a way, we have not waited one year we have
INFY_Q1_July_22_428 | actually gone ahead and done our majority of our wage hike from 1st of April this year.
INFY_Q1_July_22_429 | Increase
INFY_Q1_July_22_430 | for middle to higher level to senior force will happen in July but not the same margin impact of
INFY_Q1_July_22_431 | quarter one which was very broad based.
INFY_Q1_July_22_432 | Other than that, I think these are quite competitive and of course if you see in the mix, we also get
INFY_Q1_July_22_433 | a lot of laterals where there is a hidden cost of hiring because they come at stretches.
INFY_Q1_July_22_434 | So in a way,
INFY_Q1_July_22_435 | your overall weighted average compensation in any case is going up across.
INFY_Q1_July_22_436 | I think overall this is a
INFY_Q1_July_22_437 | very competitive hike.
INFY_Q1_July_22_438 | In India it is more like high single digits and in overseas geos because of
INFY_Q1_July_22_439 | high wage inflation across we have given very competitive hikes.
INFY_Q1_July_22_440 | This is something which we have
INFY_Q1_July_22_441 | not done before.
INFY_Q1_July_22_442 | So these are very much higher than what we did in the past.
INFY_Q1_July_22_443 | But we think this is
INFY_Q1_July_22_444 | something which is going to stand up in good stead in terms of attrition and we have seen three
INFY_Q1_July_22_445 | quarters of the attrition benefits and expect it to continue.
INFY_Q1_July_22_446 | Keith Bachman
INFY_Q1_July_22_447 | We cover a number of software companies and software companies have started to say they are
INFY_Q1_July_22_448 | seeing pockets of weakness with demand elongation on sales cycles.
INFY_Q1_July_22_449 | It does not sound like we
INFY_Q1_July_22_450 | made one very specific industry comment but it does not sound like you are seeing the same any
INFY_Q1_July_22_451 | kind of iteration on the demand side particularly on the negative side, but if you could just clarify,
INFY_Q1_July_22_452 | are you seeing any elongation on the new business front, yes or no, and if the macro does weaken
INFY_Q1_July_22_453 | will that in fact help your wage situation and that is it from me.
INFY_Q1_July_22_454 | Thank you.
INFY_Q1_July_22_455 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q1_July_22_456 | Thanks for that.
INFY_Q1_July_22_457 | A couple of points that you raised, I think what we see on the demand, the
INFY_Q1_July_22_458 | pipeline that we have today for our large deals is larger than what we had three or six months ago.
INFY_Q1_July_22_459 | Having said that, we of course recognize what is going on in the global environment and we
INFY_Q1_July_22_460 | mentioned a couple of areas.
INFY_Q1_July_22_461 | Nilanjan talked within retail, he also mentioned within Financial
INFY_Q1_July_22_462 | Services - mortgages.
INFY_Q1_July_22_463 | So we see pockets where we see some impact.
INFY_Q1_July_22_464 | On the overall deal discussions we see a little bit where it is slowing in the decision making;
INFY_Q1_July_22_465 | however, the pipeline remains strong for us today.
INFY_Q1_July_22_466 | We have also get two types of deals, one is
INFY_Q1_July_22_467 | deals which are on digital transformation or cloud which are growth orientated for clients driving to
INFY_Q1_July_22_468 | what they want to do with their customers in their supply chain, how they want to make an impact.
INFY_Q1_July_22_469 | The second is on cost, we have a very strong play on cost and efficiency through our automation
INFY_Q1_July_22_470 | work, through our artificial intelligence work where we can really impact the cost base in the tech
INFY_Q1_July_22_471 | landscape of our clients.
INFY_Q1_July_22_472 | So those are areas which we are already very active within this
INFY_Q1_July_22_473 | environment and given our positioning we feel good that those will start to come into play as and
INFY_Q1_July_22_474 | when the environment changes.
INFY_Q1_July_22_475 | But today this is how we are seeing the demand situation.
INFY_Q1_July_22_476 | Now your other question was will that have a change on the wage if the macro evolving.
INFY_Q1_July_22_477 | We do not
INFY_Q1_July_22_478 | have a clear view on where that will go because it is a function of how the macro evolves and what
INFY_Q1_July_22_479 | happens.
INFY_Q1_July_22_480 | Of course, we are seeing attrition starting to come off a little bit and that will clearly have
INFY_Q1_July_22_481 | a positive impact for us with respect to compensation.
INFY_Q1_July_22_482 | So the timeline is not clear, it depends on
INFY_Q1_July_22_483 | how the macro evolves.
INFY_Q1_July_22_484 | Keith Bachman
INFY_Q1_July_22_485 | Okay great many thanks.

INFY_Q1_July_22_488 | Nitin Padmanabhan
INFY_Q1_July_22_489 | Good morning.
INFY_Q1_July_22_490 | Thanks for the opportunity.
INFY_Q1_July_22_491 | I had two questions.
INFY_Q1_July_22_492 | One, is from a margin perspective,
INFY_Q1_July_22_493 | whatever we saw as one offs in the previous quarter which included visa and these contract
INFY_Q1_July_22_494 | provisions - both of them have been sort of offset in this quarter is that a fair understanding?
INFY_Q1_July_22_495 | The
INFY_Q1_July_22_496 | second is in terms of salary increases is it only for the associate level this quarter and if so then
INFY_Q1_July_22_497 | the question is that we have 145,000 associates JL3 and below and 130,000 people in the mid
INFY_Q1_July_22_498 | level and general understanding is mid level obviously as a percentage of the employee cost it
INFY_Q1_July_22_499 | should be higher so the thought process was about should not your margin impact be even higher
INFY_Q1_July_22_500 | next quarter - if you could just help with that thought process that will be very helpful?
INFY_Q1_July_22_501 | Those are
INFY_Q1_July_22_502 | two questions.
INFY_Q1_July_22_503 | Thank you.
INFY_Q1_July_22_504 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_505 | As I said in the margin walk, we had a benefit of 50 bps in RPP which is a combination of clients
INFY_Q1_July_22_506 | contractual provisions reversals partially offset by the discounts.
INFY_Q1_July_22_507 | So we have seen a benefit there.
INFY_Q1_July_22_508 | There is no way we said that has it been eroded, we have caught the benefit of client contractual
INFY_Q1_July_22_509 | provisions clearly.
INFY_Q1_July_22_510 | The other one on visa, travel - I think they largely offset each other.
INFY_Q1_July_22_511 | On the outlook on wages, we
INFY_Q1_July_22_512 | have done it for most of our employees, it is up to mid level.
INFY_Q1_July_22_513 | For more of the senior levels is what
INFY_Q1_July_22_514 | we are going to roll out in July and that impact would be far less than 1.6% which we have done
INFY_Q1_July_22_515 | which is a much more broad based for us.
INFY_Q1_July_22_516 | Nitin Padmanabhan
INFY_Q1_July_22_517 | Both associates and mid level happen this quarter itself.
INFY_Q1_July_22_518 | It is not only associate.
INFY_Q1_July_22_519 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_520 | Yes, associates and mid level, correct.
INFY_Q1_July_22_521 | Nitin Padmanabhan
INFY_Q1_July_22_522 | Correct that is very helpful.
INFY_Q1_July_22_523 | Thank you so much.

INFY_Q1_July_22_527 | Thanks for taking the question.
INFY_Q1_July_22_528 | I wanted to just dig on the commentary around pockets of
INFY_Q1_July_22_529 | weakness.
INFY_Q1_July_22_530 | So I heard you mentioned mortgages, mentioned subcomponent of retail.
INFY_Q1_July_22_531 | Can you just
INFY_Q1_July_22_532 | give us a sense and quantify what mix of your business is actually seeing some slowing decision
INFY_Q1_July_22_533 | making is it 5%, is it 10%, is it less and even does this help frame or quantify areas that are seeing
INFY_Q1_July_22_534 | pockets of weakness?
INFY_Q1_July_22_535 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q1_July_22_536 | Thanks for your question.
INFY_Q1_July_22_537 | This is Salil.
INFY_Q1_July_22_538 | We do not quantify typically what part of Financial Services
INFY_Q1_July_22_539 | is mortgages or the other areas which are impacted.
INFY_Q1_July_22_540 | We are now seeing pockets, this is not across
INFY_Q1_July_22_541 | our whole business.
INFY_Q1_July_22_542 | And the way I would look at it is with all of that given our pipeline we have
INFY_Q1_July_22_543 | increased our revenue guidance.
INFY_Q1_July_22_544 | So the majority of our business is still seeing good demand.
INFY_Q1_July_22_545 | It is
INFY_Q1_July_22_546 | really pockets without quantifying, that is how I would give a context to it.
INFY_Q1_July_22_547 | Bryan Bergin
INFY_Q1_July_22_548 | Okay and then just a follow-up on margin.
INFY_Q1_July_22_549 | You gave sequential changes can you give us what the
INFY_Q1_July_22_550 | year-on-year changes in operating margin with the different categories?
INFY_Q1_July_22_551 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_552 | So largely we know it was the comp related hike that is near only about 370 basis points that was
INFY_Q1_July_22_553 | the biggest one and there were some rupee benefits offset by both cross currency as well and
INFY_Q1_July_22_554 | then we got some benefits of cost optimization, we got some hits on lower utilization.
INFY_Q1_July_22_555 | So these are
INFY_Q1_July_22_556 | the broad things but the biggest one was the comp which was about 370 basis points.
INFY_Q1_July_22_557 | Bryan Bergin
INFY_Q1_July_22_558 | Alright thank you.

INFY_Q1_July_22_562 | Sudheer Guntupalli
INFY_Q1_July_22_563 | Good morning gentlemen.
INFY_Q1_July_22_564 | Thanks for giving me this opportunity.
INFY_Q1_July_22_565 | I have just one question on
INFY_Q1_July_22_566 | margins.
INFY_Q1_July_22_567 | Ideally the strong growth at the headline level should have translated into some operating
INFY_Q1_July_22_568 | leverage, but that does not seem to be happening and Nilanjan we seem to be of the view, we will
INFY_Q1_July_22_569 | chase growth for now and focus on margin optimization at a later date.
INFY_Q1_July_22_570 | What is the risk to that
INFY_Q1_July_22_571 | hypothesis because this growth margin paradox seem to be a mere reflection of what is happening
INFY_Q1_July_22_572 | in U.S. and U.K. now a very tight job market, very high nominal growth, but very little benefit
INFY_Q1_July_22_573 | trickling down to the bottomline level.
INFY_Q1_July_22_574 | So sooner or later this nominal growth rates may cool off and
INFY_Q1_July_22_575 | onsite job markets and some supply costs may auto recalibrate.
INFY_Q1_July_22_576 | But back in India job market may
INFY_Q1_July_22_577 | not be as much of a free market as it is in U.K. and U.S. there may be some sticky elements both
INFY_Q1_July_22_578 | at headcount and wage level translating into negative operating leverage as demand moderates.
INFY_Q1_July_22_579 | So what is the risk that margins will remain structurally lower than even the pre-COVID levels
INFY_Q1_July_22_580 | going ahead because demand tends to be more cyclical while some of these supply costs tend to
INFY_Q1_July_22_581 | be more sticky?
INFY_Q1_July_22_582 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_583 | There are a couple of things.
INFY_Q1_July_22_584 | See one is that many of these cost increases cannot be passed on
INFY_Q1_July_22_585 | the client on day one.
INFY_Q1_July_22_586 | If I have to give a wage hike on all my existing base they will come up for
INFY_Q1_July_22_587 | renewals that is the time when you have a wage discussion.
INFY_Q1_July_22_588 | When you are doing new deal,
INFY_Q1_July_22_589 | automatically we will build it and the industry in a way will build it into their wage profile.
INFY_Q1_July_22_590 | So these
INFY_Q1_July_22_591 | things will automatically flow back, there is no free lunch for anybody.
INFY_Q1_July_22_592 | So that is one thing which
INFY_Q1_July_22_593 | will happen over a period of time, but that is more of a generic point I am making.
INFY_Q1_July_22_594 | But in terms of
INFY_Q1_July_22_595 | subcons, we have operated at 6%-6.5% of subcon; today we are sitting at 11.3%, there is no
INFY_Q1_July_22_596 | reason for us to be at these levels unless we know what the job market is.
INFY_Q1_July_22_597 | In the overall demand
INFY_Q1_July_22_598 | environment, when our recruiting picks up we can replace these subcons with our own headcount,
INFY_Q1_July_22_599 | put more freshers into projects and this is something we have been doing very well in the past as
INFY_Q1_July_22_600 | well.
INFY_Q1_July_22_601 | So I think these levers are well known for us, we know how utilization works, our pyramid
INFY_Q1_July_22_602 | works, so we are quite confident in the forward model of taking out cost from our overall structure.
INFY_Q1_July_22_603 | Sudheer Guntupalli
INFY_Q1_July_22_604 | Just one more question if I may.
INFY_Q1_July_22_605 | So when we say the pipeline is larger now, just curious if the
INFY_Q1_July_22_606 | pipeline is getting bigger and bigger because some of the decision making is getting slower, is
INFY_Q1_July_22_607 | there any correlation you read in between the two?
INFY_Q1_July_22_608 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q1_July_22_609 | The pipeline what we are seeing is there is appetite and you go by different industry for Digital
INFY_Q1_July_22_610 | transformation programs, for large cloud programs, for programs which start to relate to cost and
INFY_Q1_July_22_611 | efficiency, that is what is in the pipeline.
INFY_Q1_July_22_612 | It is not a function of the timeline which the delay that you
INFY_Q1_July_22_613 | referenced which is causing an increase, it is where we see traction with more and more client
INFY_Q1_July_22_614 | discussions as of today that we see.
INFY_Q1_July_22_615 | Now we will see how that evolves, that is the outlook we have
INFY_Q1_July_22_616 | today.
INFY_Q1_July_22_617 | Sudheer Guntupalli
INFY_Q1_July_22_618 | Thanks Salil.
INFY_Q1_July_22_619 | Thanks Nilanjan.
INFY_Q1_July_22_620 | That is it from my side.
INFY_Q1_July_22_621 | All the very best.

INFY_Q1_July_22_624 | Thank you for taking my question.
INFY_Q1_July_22_625 | First question is what is the level of conservatism or realism
INFY_Q1_July_22_626 | infused into both the revenue and the margin guide this time, part of that is on the revenue guide
INFY_Q1_July_22_627 | we have given the potential macro headwinds ahead of us and the ask rate from the second half of
INFY_Q1_July_22_628 | this year.
INFY_Q1_July_22_629 | Similarly, on margins we still have another round of wage hikes which can impact
INFY_Q1_July_22_630 | margins by maybe as much as 100 basis points if I look at the wage hike impact so far and a
INFY_Q1_July_22_631 | similar ratio between the first and the second rounds in the previous years and also keeping up
INFY_Q1_July_22_632 | travel and facility costs?
INFY_Q1_July_22_633 | Thank you.
INFY_Q1_July_22_634 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q1_July_22_635 | Thanks for the question.
INFY_Q1_July_22_636 | This is Salil.
INFY_Q1_July_22_637 | Let me start off and then Nilanjan may have a few points to
INFY_Q1_July_22_638 | add.
INFY_Q1_July_22_639 | On the guidance for growth, as we have shared in the past, the approach we take is we see
INFY_Q1_July_22_640 | how things are as we look at the financial year today.
INFY_Q1_July_22_641 | What we saw is in Q1 we had extremely
INFY_Q1_July_22_642 | strong revenue growth - 5.5% and we also had underlying volume growth which was very strong.
INFY_Q1_July_22_643 | When we see the outlook, where we have clarity looking ahead for some period of time and then a
INFY_Q1_July_22_644 | set of estimates that we have for the rest of the financial year and also looking at how typically H2
INFY_Q1_July_22_645 | works versus H1 and then putting in some views on where the end of the year could be.
INFY_Q1_July_22_646 | Based on
INFY_Q1_July_22_647 | that, we felt comfortable to increase the revenue growth guidance, whether it is conservative or
INFY_Q1_July_22_648 | realistic that is the approach we take to make sure that we then share what we think the revenue is
INFY_Q1_July_22_649 | going to look like from here.
INFY_Q1_July_22_650 | On the margin I will start off and then Nilanjan will talk a little bit about the wage component and
INFY_Q1_July_22_651 | what we have done.
INFY_Q1_July_22_652 | Overall on the margin, we have made sure that we work to get all of the
INFY_Q1_July_22_653 | levers in place.
INFY_Q1_July_22_654 | So the approach to driving cost efficiency is in place, several levers that Nilanjan
INFY_Q1_July_22_655 | mentioned, one of the bigger ones we got the bulk impact, the vast majority of our compensation
INFY_Q1_July_22_656 | increase already done in Q1.
INFY_Q1_July_22_657 | So yes there is a small component but it is not really a huge
INFY_Q1_July_22_658 | component that will come up and then we see steadily other areas which will help us.
INFY_Q1_July_22_659 | There are
INFY_Q1_July_22_660 | areas where we can focus on how the subcontracting works, there are areas where we can focus
INFY_Q1_July_22_661 | on discussions with clients vis-à-vis wage increases and COLA, areas where we are doing work
INFY_Q1_July_22_662 | which is having significant impact for clients.
INFY_Q1_July_22_663 | So we think there are a set of those levers that can help us through the margin discussion that will
INFY_Q1_July_22_664 | be focused on in this financial year.
INFY_Q1_July_22_665 | Our approach is to make sure that we remain a high margin
INFY_Q1_July_22_666 | business and that is the underlying thing that we are working with.
INFY_Q1_July_22_667 | Given where we are, given the
INFY_Q1_July_22_668 | inflation around the world, we thought it was clear to make sure that we communicated that in the
INFY_Q1_July_22_669 | way we see the markets.
INFY_Q1_July_22_670 | Nilanjan, anything else, if you want to add?
INFY_Q1_July_22_671 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_672 | No.
INFY_Q1_July_22_673 | That is good.
INFY_Q1_July_22_674 | Ankur Rudra
INFY_Q1_July_22_675 | Just a quick follow-up if I may on margins.
INFY_Q1_July_22_676 | Nilanjan are there any one-offs in the margin this time,
INFY_Q1_July_22_677 | asking another way what would be the pro-forma margins, if the provision reversal was not to
INFY_Q1_July_22_678 | happen and related to that can you say that 20% in Q1 should be the bottom of margins going
INFY_Q1_July_22_679 | forward so that we can get back to 21% for the year realistically?
INFY_Q1_July_22_680 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_681 | Yes, so I think we have mentioned the margin walk at the beginning of the call.
INFY_Q1_July_22_682 | So if we are at
INFY_Q1_July_22_683 | 20% and we are guiding at the bottom end of 21%, so mathematics indicates that we have to
INFY_Q1_July_22_684 | improve going forward.
INFY_Q1_July_22_685 | So absolutely, from 20% we will have to see the improvement quarter-on-
INFY_Q1_July_22_686 | quarter.
INFY_Q1_July_22_687 | Ankur Rudra
INFY_Q1_July_22_688 | Thank you and best of luck.

INFY_Q1_July_22_690 | Ravi Menon
INFY_Q1_July_22_691 | Congrats on good set of numbers.
INFY_Q1_July_22_692 | Just wanted your thoughts on how broad based in North
INFY_Q1_July_22_693 | America you will see such problems to sustain for a long time until you call out some headwinds in
INFY_Q1_July_22_694 | BFSI, even that still have quite a bit of revenue.
INFY_Q1_July_22_695 | If you could give some color about how sustained
INFY_Q1_July_22_696 | the demand environment is there.
INFY_Q1_July_22_697 | And secondly on the pyramids, we have already seen a large
INFY_Q1_July_22_698 | intake of freshers last year so had hoped that some of that would have come into production and
INFY_Q1_July_22_699 | helped us offset the margin headwinds through this quarter but looks like given the utilization, as
INFY_Q1_July_22_700 | well it does not look like much of that has happened.
INFY_Q1_July_22_701 | So, if you could give some color on that?
INFY_Q1_July_22_702 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q1_July_22_703 | This is Salil.
INFY_Q1_July_22_704 | I did not catch the first part of the question.
INFY_Q1_July_22_705 | I think it was about demand but maybe
INFY_Q1_July_22_706 | you can just say the first question?
INFY_Q1_July_22_707 | Ravi Menon
INFY_Q1_July_22_708 | It was around the demand.
INFY_Q1_July_22_709 | We have seen broad-based revenue addition across verticals in North
INFY_Q1_July_22_710 | America and if you are seeing the pipeline also along similar lines.
INFY_Q1_July_22_711 | So are there any specific
INFY_Q1_July_22_712 | verticals where you see some softness starting to come in?
INFY_Q1_July_22_713 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q1_July_22_714 | As we referenced, we see some pockets of softness within our overall business.
INFY_Q1_July_22_715 | That is why we
INFY_Q1_July_22_716 | wanted to be very clear that that is something that is visible.
INFY_Q1_July_22_717 | Couple of examples we have shared
INFY_Q1_July_22_718 | on Financial Services and Retail, there are areas where we see that weakness; however, once we
INFY_Q1_July_22_719 | say that we also have a view and we see it in our pipeline the overall pipeline is stronger.
INFY_Q1_July_22_720 | So there
INFY_Q1_July_22_721 | are areas where we see some good traction as well and it is a mix of the growth and the cost
INFY_Q1_July_22_722 | opportunities within our pipeline.
INFY_Q1_July_22_723 | I think the second one was about the pyramid?
INFY_Q1_July_22_724 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_725 | Yes we have hired a lot of freshers last year and many of them also have gone into training
INFY_Q1_July_22_726 | pipeline because as we had the previous year there was nothing really in the pipeline in terms of
INFY_Q1_July_22_727 | hiring.
INFY_Q1_July_22_728 | So in fact if you see our utilization there is a 2% gap between the excluding trainees and
INFY_Q1_July_22_729 | including trainee numbers on a year-on-year basis as well.
INFY_Q1_July_22_730 | We continue to deploy them into
INFY_Q1_July_22_731 | projects.
INFY_Q1_July_22_732 | Like I said, you cannot overnight stuff projects with freshers and that is why it is important
INFY_Q1_July_22_733 | to build a pipeline in advance and make them go through the trainings and then put them into
INFY_Q1_July_22_734 | production bench and then move them into projects as well.
INFY_Q1_July_22_735 | So that benefit will come in and we
INFY_Q1_July_22_736 | are seeing that slowly coming in, but it is important to invest ahead.
INFY_Q1_July_22_737 | If you are planning just in time,
INFY_Q1_July_22_738 | you will be probably sub optimizing in terms of how fast you can deploy.
INFY_Q1_July_22_739 | So that is why we have
INFY_Q1_July_22_740 | made these investments because we know it will take time for these freshers to be productive,
INFY_Q1_July_22_741 | hence it is important to make that investment ahead.
INFY_Q1_July_22_742 | Ravi Menon
INFY_Q1_July_22_743 | Thanks gentlemen.
INFY_Q1_July_22_744 | One follow-up of this last quarter's contractual revenue.
INFY_Q1_July_22_745 | So did you recognize
INFY_Q1_July_22_746 | all of them this quarter or is there still something pending?
INFY_Q1_July_22_747 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_748 | Yes, it was all recognized this quarter.
INFY_Q1_July_22_749 | Ravi Menon
INFY_Q1_July_22_750 | Thank you.

INFY_Q1_July_22_754 | Thanks for the opportunity.
INFY_Q1_July_22_755 | Salil can you give some color on the overall order book since the
INFY_Q1_July_22_756 | reported TCV, what we give that covers only $50 mn plus deal and may not really be
INFY_Q1_July_22_757 | representative.
INFY_Q1_July_22_758 | So any quantitative or qualitative comment on the scale and how the overall order
INFY_Q1_July_22_759 | book has grown, that will be helpful?
INFY_Q1_July_22_760 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q1_July_22_761 | Thanks for the question.
INFY_Q1_July_22_762 | As you know, we share the large deal win numbers.
INFY_Q1_July_22_763 | We do not publish
INFY_Q1_July_22_764 | the overall deal wins.
INFY_Q1_July_22_765 | Having said that, the main context I would put is the increase in the growth
INFY_Q1_July_22_766 | guidance that we have provided and that factors in all of the inputs that you may be looking for,
INFY_Q1_July_22_767 | which essentially comes from a very strong Q1 execution - 5.5% QoQ, 21.4% YoY growth and
INFY_Q1_July_22_768 | then a view that we have on what we see in the coming quarters and an overall view of H1, H2 in
INFY_Q1_July_22_769 | our mix within the company - that is sort of broadly how we looked at it.
INFY_Q1_July_22_770 | On the large deals, we
INFY_Q1_July_22_771 | have shared this in the past.
INFY_Q1_July_22_772 | Typically, this is a number which is a little bit more volatile because
INFY_Q1_July_22_773 | we only report deals which are larger than $50 million in our large deals and so that is really the
INFY_Q1_July_22_774 | way you can look at.
INFY_Q1_July_22_775 | Pankaj Kapoor
INFY_Q1_July_22_776 | My second question is on the profitability in the manufacturing vertical where the margins have
INFY_Q1_July_22_777 | been coming down and in fact the last three quarters probably they have halved despite a very
INFY_Q1_July_22_778 | strong revenue growth.
INFY_Q1_July_22_779 | I understand this could be because of a very large deal which is still
INFY_Q1_July_22_780 | ramping up there, can you give a sense of how the profitability curve in this vertical could shape
INFY_Q1_July_22_781 | over the next two, three quarters.
INFY_Q1_July_22_782 | What I am trying to understand is that has it bottomed out now or
INFY_Q1_July_22_783 | you think that this could potentially go down further?
INFY_Q1_July_22_784 | Thank you.
INFY_Q1_July_22_785 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_786 | Firstly, you have seen the revenue growth which has been quite spectacular in this segment.
INFY_Q1_July_22_787 | This
INFY_Q1_July_22_788 | has been led by large deals.
INFY_Q1_July_22_789 | As we talk about our approach, from day one a lot of clients would
INFY_Q1_July_22_790 | like to see savings, but we are very clear that over a period of time we have a lot of cost
INFY_Q1_July_22_791 | optimization levers.
INFY_Q1_July_22_792 | On day one you cannot pivot the cost structure, whereas clients may ask for
INFY_Q1_July_22_793 | the savings, but we know there are enough levers over time that we continue to deploy on all
INFY_Q1_July_22_794 | these large deals.
INFY_Q1_July_22_795 | And if I go back to the last three years, four years in fact when the large deal
INFY_Q1_July_22_796 | strategy started, we have actually seen an increase in margins over that period.
INFY_Q1_July_22_797 | So, there is no
INFY_Q1_July_22_798 | historical correlation in saying whether the large deals are dilutive, because we continue working
INFY_Q1_July_22_799 | on taking out costs from the system and that gets factored into our entire process.
INFY_Q1_July_22_800 | We look at how
INFY_Q1_July_22_801 | we are going to optimize onsite offshore, many of these projects require dramatic automation, we
INFY_Q1_July_22_802 | can inject that through all our services which we are providing, we know how the pyramid works.
INFY_Q1_July_22_803 | So these are the things which we know works over the lifetime of these large deals and that is
INFY_Q1_July_22_804 | something we know we can deploy.
INFY_Q1_July_22_805 | So that is something, without getting specifically into
INFY_Q1_July_22_806 | manufacturing, what we do well.
INFY_Q1_July_22_807 | Pankaj Kapoor
INFY_Q1_July_22_808 | Got it.

INFY_Q1_July_22_812 | Gaurav Rateria
INFY_Q1_July_22_813 | Good morning.
INFY_Q1_July_22_814 | Thank you for taking my question.
INFY_Q1_July_22_815 | So firstly is there any difference in the client
INFY_Q1_July_22_816 | decision making behavior in U.S. versus European clients and the reason is that I am asking is
INFY_Q1_July_22_817 | U.S. is seeing fair bit of broad-based growth across segments but when you look at Europe, there
INFY_Q1_July_22_818 | is a weakness specifically in retail and communication vertical whereas the other two verticals,
INFY_Q1_July_22_819 | energy, Hi-Tech has grown very, very well.
INFY_Q1_July_22_820 | So just trying to understand are there any client
INFY_Q1_July_22_821 | specific pockets especially in Europe where you kind of see decision making behavior has
INFY_Q1_July_22_822 | changed compared to the U.S. market?
INFY_Q1_July_22_823 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q1_July_22_824 | Thanks for that question.
INFY_Q1_July_22_825 | Today we are not seeing something which is more geography based as
INFY_Q1_July_22_826 | you are describing.
INFY_Q1_July_22_827 | We see something which is more globally industry-based and client based, as
INFY_Q1_July_22_828 | you know well is mainly U.S, Europe and Australia.
INFY_Q1_July_22_829 | So not so much color on which is more
INFY_Q1_July_22_830 | geography related.
INFY_Q1_July_22_831 | Gaurav Rateria
INFY_Q1_July_22_832 | Second question on margins, your margin outlook at the lower end - you explained very well the
INFY_Q1_July_22_833 | supply side and cost related factors which has led to this, but is there also an element of
INFY_Q1_July_22_834 | expectation of pricing increase that has been tapered down, which has led to you to now take the
INFY_Q1_July_22_835 | margin outlook to the lower end and is it fair to say that with all the cost levers that you have in
INFY_Q1_July_22_836 | place the exit margin should be better than the lower end of the guidance?
INFY_Q1_July_22_837 | Thank you.
INFY_Q1_July_22_838 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_839 | I think when we do our margins forecast with a combination of factors that we look at and that
INFY_Q1_July_22_840 | equation keeps on changing and it is more dynamic.
INFY_Q1_July_22_841 | What happened in the previous quarter, what
INFY_Q1_July_22_842 | do we see as outlook, what is happening on subcon, wage inflation - so that mix continues to
INFY_Q1_July_22_843 | change and evolve.
INFY_Q1_July_22_844 | Sometimes we have to push harder on some pedals in terms of accelerating
INFY_Q1_July_22_845 | some programs.
INFY_Q1_July_22_846 | And then going back to the level where we are today at 20% and we are saying
INFY_Q1_July_22_847 | we will be at the bottom end of 21%, I think that should give you a good sense of the margin
INFY_Q1_July_22_848 | trajectory for the rest of the year.
INFY_Q1_July_22_849 | Gaurav Rateria
INFY_Q1_July_22_850 | Thank you.

INFY_Q1_July_22_853 | Ritesh Rathod
INFY_Q1_July_22_854 | Just on this margin within a quarter you have to lower your guidance on the margin side so this is
INFY_Q1_July_22_855 | despite rupee depreciation benefit, despite attrition coming down in last two quarters.
INFY_Q1_July_22_856 | So what has
INFY_Q1_July_22_857 | surprised internally in your expectations, so that you have to bring it down to the lower end?
INFY_Q1_July_22_858 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_859 | Yes, I think I just mentioned this is a very dynamic and moving forecast completely.
INFY_Q1_July_22_860 | What is the
INFY_Q1_July_22_861 | impact of attrition, how much wage hikes will come in, new hires - it is very dynamic, how the
INFY_Q1_July_22_862 | pricing plays out.
INFY_Q1_July_22_863 | So, this is a very fluid situation, but the 21% to 23% band we said, we are within
INFY_Q1_July_22_864 | that but of course at the bottom end of it.
INFY_Q1_July_22_865 | We are committed from where we are today at 20% to do
INFY_Q1_July_22_866 | all our various cost optimizations, factoring the cost impacts of what we see in terms of wage
INFY_Q1_July_22_867 | inflation there could be potential benefits of the rupee etc.
INFY_Q1_July_22_868 | So it is a combination of all this into the
INFY_Q1_July_22_869 | forecast.
INFY_Q1_July_22_870 | Ritesh Rathod
INFY_Q1_July_22_871 | What would have been the bigger surprise element?
INFY_Q1_July_22_872 | would it be the wage or would it be the pricing
INFY_Q1_July_22_873 | benefit not coming through?
INFY_Q1_July_22_874 | Any one highlight compared to what you expected at the start of the
INFY_Q1_July_22_875 | year?
INFY_Q1_July_22_876 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_877 | It is a combination of various things and I would not say surprise.
INFY_Q1_July_22_878 | Like I said, it is a fluid situation
INFY_Q1_July_22_879 | and we have to remain agile.
INFY_Q1_July_22_880 | That is more important rather than anything else.
INFY_Q1_July_22_881 | Ritesh Rathod
INFY_Q1_July_22_882 | Coming to pockets of weakness which is pointed out in retail, mortgages, can you give some color
INFY_Q1_July_22_883 | are clients taking a pause in decision making, are the new deals not getting converted or are the
INFY_Q1_July_22_884 | existing deals which have been moving, they are not getting ramped up?
INFY_Q1_July_22_885 | What is the exact sense
INFY_Q1_July_22_886 | on the business over there?
INFY_Q1_July_22_887 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q1_July_22_888 | There within the areas of that pockets that we described, there we see a slowing.
INFY_Q1_July_22_889 | For example, if
INFY_Q1_July_22_890 | you look at the mortgage situation the volume there in the market meaning the client volume as a
INFY_Q1_July_22_891 | macro level has gone down in the European and U.S. market.
INFY_Q1_July_22_892 | So our work there is proportionally
INFY_Q1_July_22_893 | reduced.
INFY_Q1_July_22_894 | The overall point which I shared earlier, we see some slowing in decision making but
INFY_Q1_July_22_895 | nonetheless the pipeline remains today in a good position and that allows us to increase the
INFY_Q1_July_22_896 | guidance.
INFY_Q1_July_22_897 | Ritesh Rathod
INFY_Q1_July_22_898 | Maybe last one on your deal wins on LTM basis, your deal wins are down sharply if you see last
INFY_Q1_July_22_899 | three, four quarters versus the previous four quarters and even if I adjust the base because of the
INFY_Q1_July_22_900 | high value deals, which you won in a couple of quarters, four, quarters back, you are still down
INFY_Q1_July_22_901 | minimum by 15%, how do you connect those two dots that your LTM deal wins are down but your
INFY_Q1_July_22_902 | deal pipeline is all time high.
INFY_Q1_July_22_903 | Are the deal conversion ratios dropping then what it was used to be?
INFY_Q1_July_22_904 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q1_July_22_905 | There on the large deals we always see some volatility because these are deals which were
INFY_Q1_July_22_906 | larger, the ones we share in this number are larger than $50 mn in value.
INFY_Q1_July_22_907 | We do see the pipeline
INFY_Q1_July_22_908 | being larger than where it was and what we referenced in some areas slowing of it, that we do not
INFY_Q1_July_22_909 | see any change in the other parameters of the pipeline.
INFY_Q1_July_22_910 | Ritesh Rathod
INFY_Q1_July_22_911 | Okay thank you wish you good luck.

INFY_Q1_July_22_915 | Thank you for the opportunity and sorry for harping on the margin question once again.
INFY_Q1_July_22_916 | I just
INFY_Q1_July_22_917 | wanted to understand how should we be thinking about the segmental or the improvement in
INFY_Q1_July_22_918 | segmental margins for manufacturing vertical given the sharp drop that we have seen over the last
INFY_Q1_July_22_919 | three quarters and how does that heal in terms of the overall margin outlook?
INFY_Q1_July_22_920 | Thank you.
INFY_Q1_July_22_921 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q1_July_22_922 | Somebody else has asked a similar question and without going into any specifics, we have seen
INFY_Q1_July_22_923 | that growth coming out of a large deal in manufacturing and like you said as we look at the tenure
INFY_Q1_July_22_924 | of these large deals in some cases they start off with lower than portfolio margins because clients
INFY_Q1_July_22_925 | may ask for savings upfront but we have already started plan in terms of over quarter-on-quarters
INFY_Q1_July_22_926 | what do we need to do to bring back profitability because from day one clients come to us because
INFY_Q1_July_22_927 | they know we can optimize the cost structure.
INFY_Q1_July_22_928 | So that is something which is generically what we
INFY_Q1_July_22_929 | have been doing and since we started the large deal strategy and we have seen margin
INFY_Q1_July_22_930 | improvements over that period.
INFY_Q1_July_22_931 | So I think we are quite confident of the future profile of these
INFY_Q1_July_22_932 | businesses.
INFY_Q1_July_22_933 | Manik Taneja
INFY_Q1_July_22_934 | Sure thank you.

INFY_Q1_July_22_938 | Thanks for taking my question.
INFY_Q1_July_22_939 | Salil this is on mega deals while the industry frequency tends to be
INFY_Q1_July_22_940 | low and it has been a while for Infosys it will be good to know your comments on mega deals from
INFY_Q1_July_22_941 | a pipeline perspective and secondly on pricing how is the ability to get price increase versus last
INFY_Q1_July_22_942 | quarter do you see any changes to that?
INFY_Q1_July_22_943 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q1_July_22_944 | From the mega deals, I think again we do not share anything specific in terms of what we publish.
INFY_Q1_July_22_945 | The color from our side is we have mega deals in our pipeline, if that will give you a context.
INFY_Q1_July_22_946 | On the pricing, we have seen pricing currently holding in our deal values for Q1.
INFY_Q1_July_22_947 | My sense is we
INFY_Q1_July_22_948 | have seen examples that Nilanjan was sharing earlier where we are working, we have worked with
INFY_Q1_July_22_949 | clients to demonstrate to them the impact of compensation increases and that has translated to
INFY_Q1_July_22_950 | COLA or price benefits.
INFY_Q1_July_22_951 | We have had examples where we have had increases, which are related
INFY_Q1_July_22_952 | to the digital high value work that we are driving for clients.
INFY_Q1_July_22_953 | We now have to make sure we take
INFY_Q1_July_22_954 | that across a whole portfolio and see the benefits coming into our business.
INFY_Q1_July_22_955 | Typically the salary
INFY_Q1_July_22_956 | increase happens at a periodic time and these things where we have not seen a high inflation
INFY_Q1_July_22_957 | environment like this for over 40 years in the western markets that takes a longer time.
INFY_Q1_July_22_958 | That is
INFY_Q1_July_22_959 | what as Nilanjan shared is part of what we have put in place to support our margin as we go
INFY_Q1_July_22_960 | ahead.
INFY_Q1_July_22_961 | Apurva Prasad
INFY_Q1_July_22_962 | Thank you for that.
INFY_Q1_July_22_963 | Moderator
INFY_Q1_July_22_964 | Thank you.
INFY_Q1_July_22_965 | Ladies and gentlemen that was the last question.
INFY_Q1_July_22_966 | I now hand the conference over to
INFY_Q1_July_22_967 | the management for closing comments.
INFY_Q1_July_22_968 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q1_July_22_969 | points; first we have had industry leading growth in Q1, 5.5% quarterly, 21.4% year-on-year.
INFY_Q1_July_22_970 | We
INFY_Q1_July_22_971 | clearly see a tremendous market share gain driven primarily by the strength of our digital and
INFY_Q1_July_22_972 | cloud - cobalt capability set that is resonating with our clients.
INFY_Q1_July_22_973 | We highlighted there are pockets of
INFY_Q1_July_22_974 | weakness and we are aware of the environment around us.
INFY_Q1_July_22_975 | We see in our pipeline both growth
INFY_Q1_July_22_976 | opportunities in digital cloud and cost opportunities in automation.
INFY_Q1_July_22_977 | With all of that, we increase the
INFY_Q1_July_22_978 | growth guidance for the full year.
INFY_Q1_July_22_979 | We are now seeing attrition coming down on a quarterly basis.
INFY_Q1_July_22_980 | We see many of the initiatives we
INFY_Q1_July_22_981 | put in place starting to create some impact.
INFY_Q1_July_22_982 | We have levers for the margin, several that Nilanjan
INFY_Q1_July_22_983 | shared, large programs will transition to steady state, COLA because of increases in
INFY_Q1_July_22_984 | compensation costs to pricing, pyramid adjustments as we have college hires joining the
INFY_Q1_July_22_985 | production environment, subcontractor usage and then several others on the cost side.
INFY_Q1_July_22_986 | Given all of
INFY_Q1_July_22_987 | that we feel we are already well positioned to work with clients on their growth and cost
INFY_Q1_July_22_988 | opportunities and have a margin profile that is something that sustains the high margin approach
INFY_Q1_July_22_989 | of the company.
INFY_Q1_July_22_990 | We are looking forward to this year with strength and optimism.
