INFY_Q4_April_22_28 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q4_April_22_29 | Thanks, Sandeep.
INFY_Q4_April_22_30 | Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to everyone joining
INFY_Q4_April_22_31 | on the call.
INFY_Q4_April_22_32 | Thank you for taking the time to join us today.
INFY_Q4_April_22_33 | We have had an exceptional year with an annual growth of 19.7% in constant currency
INFY_Q4_April_22_34 | terms, which is the fastest growth we have seen in 11 years.
INFY_Q4_April_22_35 | We are gaining market
INFY_Q4_April_22_36 | share.
INFY_Q4_April_22_37 | We are building on our leadership in cloud and digital, and we are a part of more
INFY_Q4_April_22_38 | and more programs that our clients are looking at in digital transformation.
INFY_Q4_April_22_39 | Growth was broad-based across business segments, service lines and geographies.
INFY_Q4_April_22_40 | Each
INFY_Q4_April_22_41 | of our business segments grew in double digits.
INFY_Q4_April_22_42 | The top 3 grew in high teens, U.S. and
INFY_Q4_April_22_43 | Europe grew over 20%.
INFY_Q4_April_22_44 | The North America region crossed $10 bn in revenue, while
INFY_Q4_April_22_45 | Financial Services crossed $5 bn revenue milestones.
INFY_Q4_April_22_46 | Our digital revenues now account for 59.2% and grew at 41.2% for the year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_47 | Our digital
INFY_Q4_April_22_48 | revenues crossed $10 bn annualized on a run-rate basis.
INFY_Q4_April_22_49 | Within digital, our cloud work is
INFY_Q4_April_22_50 | growing faster, and our Cobalt Cloud capabilities have seen significant traction with our
INFY_Q4_April_22_51 | clients.
INFY_Q4_April_22_52 | Our growth has been accompanied by robust operating margins of 23.0%.
INFY_Q4_April_22_53 | We delivered
INFY_Q4_April_22_54 | these margins while maintaining focus on our employees with increased compensation
INFY_Q4_April_22_55 | and benefits.
INFY_Q4_April_22_56 | Our large deal wins were at $9.5 bn for the full year and were $2.3 bn for Q4.
INFY_Q4_April_22_57 | Our net new
INFY_Q4_April_22_58 | percentage was 40% for the year and 48% for Q4, helping us set up a strong growth
INFY_Q4_April_22_59 | foundation for financial year 2023.
INFY_Q4_April_22_60 | Our Q4 revenue growth was 20.6% YoY and 1.2% QoQ in constant currency terms.
INFY_Q4_April_22_61 | Our
INFY_Q4_April_22_62 | industry-leading performance in FY2022 would not have been possible without the
INFY_Q4_April_22_63 | relentless commitment from our employees.
INFY_Q4_April_22_64 | I am extremely proud as well as grateful for
INFY_Q4_April_22_65 | the extraordinary efforts in delivering success for our clients.
INFY_Q4_April_22_66 | Our last 12 months' attrition increased to 27.7%.
INFY_Q4_April_22_67 | Our quarterly annualized attrition
INFY_Q4_April_22_68 | declined by approximately 5 percentage points on a sequential basis.
INFY_Q4_April_22_69 | We recruited 85,000 college graduates in this financial year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_70 | In the fourth quarter, we had
INFY_Q4_April_22_71 | a net addition of 22,000 employees.
INFY_Q4_April_22_72 | We have an overall strong recruitment program.
INFY_Q4_April_22_73 | This
INFY_Q4_April_22_74 | is a reflection of our enhanced recruitment capabilities, solid brand and deep penetration
INFY_Q4_April_22_75 | into various talent markets.
INFY_Q4_April_22_76 | This increases our comfort to support clients in their digital
INFY_Q4_April_22_77 | transformation agenda as we look ahead.
INFY_Q4_April_22_78 | We have initiated our compensation review exercise for this financial year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_79 | We have
INFY_Q4_April_22_80 | planned this exercise so that we can focus on employee segments that need greater
INFY_Q4_April_22_81 | attention while also covering a broader group with regular increases.
INFY_Q4_April_22_82 | As in the past, we
INFY_Q4_April_22_83 | will look at individual performance, skills and market benchmarks while determining
INFY_Q4_April_22_84 | individual compensation increases.
INFY_Q4_April_22_85 | We will focus on accelerated career growth, targeted
INFY_Q4_April_22_86 | development and opportunity to work on cutting-edge digital innovation globally.
INFY_Q4_April_22_87 | Our strategy launched 4 years ago has served us well.
INFY_Q4_April_22_88 | We have delivered industry-
INFY_Q4_April_22_89 | leading growth and industry-leading TSR.
INFY_Q4_April_22_90 | Looking ahead to the next phase to further enhance our leadership on the digital
INFY_Q4_April_22_91 | innovation curve, we plan to expand our capabilities in scaling our cloud business,
INFY_Q4_April_22_92 | expanding digital capability, expanding on our automation work and increasing relevance
INFY_Q4_April_22_93 | with our large clients and tech natives and also strengthen our employee value
INFY_Q4_April_22_94 | proposition.
INFY_Q4_April_22_95 | Our focus on staying ahead in the cloud and digital ecosystem, the focus on
INFY_Q4_April_22_96 | our employees and the costs give us strong confidence for the future.
INFY_Q4_April_22_97 | Our sustained momentum in FY2022, large deal wins, robust deal pipeline and client
INFY_Q4_April_22_98 | confidence give us comfort to guide for 13% to 15% growth in FY2023 in constant
INFY_Q4_April_22_99 | currency.
INFY_Q4_April_22_100 | As we look ahead – as we build our new strategy, that is looking at cloud and the digital
INFY_Q4_April_22_101 | ecosystem, our focus on employees and the costs related to the post-COVID work
INFY_Q4_April_22_102 | environment, result in our operating margin guidance to be at 21% to 23% for FY2023.
INFY_Q4_April_22_103 | In terms of our business segment performance, let me go through the highlights by
INFY_Q4_April_22_104 | segment.
INFY_Q4_April_22_105 | Financial Services segment grew at 14.1% in constant currency, with 8 large deal wins
INFY_Q4_April_22_106 | during the quarter and 27 large deal wins in FY2022.
INFY_Q4_April_22_107 | Our US business continues to lead
INFY_Q4_April_22_108 | the growth as we work on large transformation programs.
INFY_Q4_April_22_109 | Our overall large deal pipeline in
INFY_Q4_April_22_110 | Financial Services is healthy across the regions.
INFY_Q4_April_22_111 | Retail segment growth was at 16.5% in constant currency.
INFY_Q4_April_22_112 | As clients focus on digital and
INFY_Q4_April_22_113 | cost takeout programs.
INFY_Q4_April_22_114 | We are seeing integrated outsourcing deals and transformation
INFY_Q4_April_22_115 | programs in the areas of e-commerce, revenue growth management, supply chain,
INFY_Q4_April_22_116 | product life cycle management.
INFY_Q4_April_22_117 | We won 16 large deals from the segment in the last year
INFY_Q4_April_22_118 | and continue to have a healthy deal pipeline.
INFY_Q4_April_22_119 | The Communications vertical grew strongly at 29.2% in constant currency.
INFY_Q4_April_22_120 | We see
INFY_Q4_April_22_121 | customer experience, IT and network simplification, lean and automated zero-touch
INFY_Q4_April_22_122 | operations, time to market and integrated data for digital enterprise as the key themes for
INFY_Q4_April_22_123 | clients in this segment.
INFY_Q4_April_22_124 | Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services segment growth increased further to 17.8% in
INFY_Q4_April_22_125 | constant currency.
INFY_Q4_April_22_126 | We see continued and increased emphasis on digital transformation,
INFY_Q4_April_22_127 | especially around customer experience, operational efficiency and associated legacy
INFY_Q4_April_22_128 | transformation.
INFY_Q4_April_22_129 | We won 4 large deals in the last quarter and 18 large deals in FY2022
INFY_Q4_April_22_130 | from this segment.
INFY_Q4_April_22_131 | Growth in Manufacturing segment increased to over 50% in constant currency.
INFY_Q4_April_22_132 | There
INFY_Q4_April_22_133 | were 6 large deal wins in this segment in the last quarter and 13 wins for the last year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_134 | We
INFY_Q4_April_22_135 | are helping clients across engineering, IoT, supply chain, cloud ERP and digital
INFY_Q4_April_22_136 | transformation areas.
INFY_Q4_April_22_137 | Hi-Tech growth accelerated further to 20.9% in constant currency.
INFY_Q4_April_22_138 | We have seen an
INFY_Q4_April_22_139 | increase in deals based on edge computing, digital marketing and commerce.
INFY_Q4_April_22_140 | Cybersecurity is another area of focus for clients due to increased threat perception.
INFY_Q4_April_22_141 | Life Sciences vertical grew by 16.2% in constant currency.
INFY_Q4_April_22_142 | Clients are driving digital
INFY_Q4_April_22_143 | transformation of clinical trials to reduce cycle times through direct data capture, digital
INFY_Q4_April_22_144 | patient engagement to accelerate drug discovery, and reducing costs.
INFY_Q4_April_22_145 | In the last quarter, we were rated as a leader in 11 ratings in the areas of cloud services,
INFY_Q4_April_22_146 | big data and analytics, IoT and engineering, modernization and artificial intelligence.
INFY_Q4_April_22_147 | We announced the acquisition of oddity, a Germany-based digital marketing and
INFY_Q4_April_22_148 | experience and e-commerce agency.
INFY_Q4_April_22_149 | Together with Wongdoody, this will further
INFY_Q4_April_22_150 | strengthen our creative branding and experience design capabilities.
INFY_Q4_April_22_151 | With respect to capital allocation, the Board has proposed a final dividend of Rs.16 per
INFY_Q4_April_22_152 | share, taking the total dividend for financial year 2022 to Rs.31 per share, an increase of
INFY_Q4_April_22_153 | 14.8% over the past year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_154 | I want to express Infosys' support for all the people impacted by the humanitarian crisis in
INFY_Q4_April_22_155 | Europe.
INFY_Q4_April_22_156 | The company advocates for peace between Russia and Ukraine.
INFY_Q4_April_22_157 | While Infosys does not have any active relationships with local Russian enterprises.
INFY_Q4_April_22_158 | We
INFY_Q4_April_22_159 | have a small team of less than 100 employees based in Russia, which service a few of our
INFY_Q4_April_22_160 | global clients.
INFY_Q4_April_22_161 | In light of the prevailing situation, we made a decision to transition these
INFY_Q4_April_22_162 | services from Russia to our other global delivery centers.
INFY_Q4_April_22_163 | To support this humanitarian assistance initiatives in the region, Infosys has committed $1
INFY_Q4_April_22_164 | million towards Ukrainian relief efforts and is launching a program to digitally reskill up to
INFY_Q4_April_22_165 | 25,000 individuals.
INFY_Q4_April_22_166 | With that, let me hand it over to Nilanjan for his update.
INFY_Q4_April_22_167 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_168 | We navigated yet another year of a challenging environment with strong growth of 19.7%
INFY_Q4_April_22_169 | in constant currency, which is highest in a decade.
INFY_Q4_April_22_170 | The incremental revenue added this
INFY_Q4_April_22_171 | year was higher than the incremental revenue added in the previous 3 years together.
INFY_Q4_April_22_172 | This was backed by broad-based growth across segments and robust growth in our digital
INFY_Q4_April_22_173 | portfolio at 41.2% in constant currency.
INFY_Q4_April_22_174 | Operating margin for the fiscal stood at 23.0%, which was at the midpoint of our guidance
INFY_Q4_April_22_175 | band of 22% to 24%.
INFY_Q4_April_22_176 | In the backdrop of various supply side pressures, we rolled out
INFY_Q4_April_22_177 | various measures to reduce attrition – higher compensation increases, higher promotions,
INFY_Q4_April_22_178 | skill-based interventions, etc.
INFY_Q4_April_22_179 | in addition to higher subcons.
INFY_Q4_April_22_180 | Free cash flows for FY2022 crossed $3 bn.
INFY_Q4_April_22_181 | DSO reduced by 4 days to 67 days.
INFY_Q4_April_22_182 | Capex
INFY_Q4_April_22_183 | increased marginally to $290 million on the back of continued focus on optimizing the infra
INFY_Q4_April_22_184 | creation-related spend.
INFY_Q4_April_22_185 | Consequently, FCF conversion as a percentage of net profit was
INFY_Q4_April_22_186 | 103% for FY2022.
INFY_Q4_April_22_187 | FY2022 EPS grew by 14.3% in dollar terms and 15.2% in INR terms.
INFY_Q4_April_22_188 | Return on equity at
INFY_Q4_April_22_189 | 29.1% improved by 1.7% over the prior year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_190 | Coming to Q4 performance -
INFY_Q4_April_22_191 | Revenues grew by 20.6% YoY in constant currency and 1.2% sequentially.
INFY_Q4_April_22_192 | Growth was
INFY_Q4_April_22_193 | broad-based across verticals and geos and was in double digits.
INFY_Q4_April_22_194 | Although volume growth remained healthy in Q4, revenue growth in Q4 was impacted by
INFY_Q4_April_22_195 | usual seasonality, COVID impact during the early part of the quarter and the client related
INFY_Q4_April_22_196 | contractual provision, which we expect to recover in the future.
INFY_Q4_April_22_197 | This also impacted Q4
INFY_Q4_April_22_198 | margins.
INFY_Q4_April_22_199 | Mining of large clients was extremely strong in FY2022.
INFY_Q4_April_22_200 | $100 mn client count increased to
INFY_Q4_April_22_201 | 38 compared to 32 in FY2021.
INFY_Q4_April_22_202 | We had 12 clients giving $200 mn annual revenues
INFY_Q4_April_22_203 | compared to 7 in FY2021.
INFY_Q4_April_22_204 | We have added ~22,000 net employees, including trainees during the quarter, the highest
INFY_Q4_April_22_205 | ever in the company's history, as we made headroom to capture the robust demand
INFY_Q4_April_22_206 | environment ahead.
INFY_Q4_April_22_207 | Consequently, utilization in Q4 declined to 87.0% while on-site effort
INFY_Q4_April_22_208 | mix inched up to 24.0%.
INFY_Q4_April_22_209 | Voluntary LTM attrition increased to 27.7%.
INFY_Q4_April_22_210 | While LTM attrition
INFY_Q4_April_22_211 | continues to increase due to the tail effect, quarterly annualized attrition saw a decline of
INFY_Q4_April_22_212 | approximately 5% after flattening in the previous quarter.
INFY_Q4_April_22_213 | Q4 margins stood at 21.5%, a drop of 200 basis points versus previous quarter.
INFY_Q4_April_22_214 | The
INFY_Q4_April_22_215 | major components of the sequential margin movement were as follows:
INFY_Q4_April_22_216 | -
INFY_Q4_April_22_217 | 1.6% impact due to lower calendar working days, client contractual provision as
INFY_Q4_April_22_218 | explained above and other pricing puts and takes,
INFY_Q4_April_22_219 | -
INFY_Q4_April_22_220 | 0.6% impact due to lower utilization as we create capacity for the future,
INFY_Q4_April_22_221 | -
INFY_Q4_April_22_222 | 1% due to higher visa costs, third-party costs and other one-offs, which we
INFY_Q4_April_22_223 | benefited in Q3,
INFY_Q4_April_22_224 | and these were offset by
INFY_Q4_April_22_225 | -
INFY_Q4_April_22_226 | approximately 1.1% benefit due to salary-related benefits, including lower working
INFY_Q4_April_22_227 | days, leave costs and others.
INFY_Q4_April_22_228 | Q4 EPS grew by 9.2% in dollar terms and 13.4% in rupee terms on a YoY basis.
INFY_Q4_April_22_229 | Our balance sheet remained strong and debt-free.
INFY_Q4_April_22_230 | Consolidated cash and equivalents
INFY_Q4_April_22_231 | increased further to $4.9 bn at the end of the quarter.
INFY_Q4_April_22_232 | Free cash flow for the quarter was
INFY_Q4_April_22_233 | healthy at $761 million, and yield on cash balance remained stable at 5.29% in Q4.
INFY_Q4_April_22_234 | In line with our capital allocation policy, the Board has recommended a final dividend of
INFY_Q4_April_22_235 | Rs.16 per share, which will result in a total dividend of Rs.31 per share for FY2022 versus
INFY_Q4_April_22_236 | Rs.27 per share for FY2021, an increase of 14.8% per share for the year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_237 | Including the
INFY_Q4_April_22_238 | final dividend and recently concluded buyback over the last 3 years, we have returned
INFY_Q4_April_22_239 | 73% of FCF to shareholders under our current capital allocation policy.
INFY_Q4_April_22_240 | Our accelerated investments in the last few years in strengthening our digital footprint,
INFY_Q4_April_22_241 | enhancing large deal capabilities, localization, talent building has enabled us to gain
INFY_Q4_April_22_242 | consistent market share.
INFY_Q4_April_22_243 | With the acceleration of digital disruptions across industries, we
INFY_Q4_April_22_244 | see further scope to engage more closely with clients and capitalize on the expanding
INFY_Q4_April_22_245 | market opportunities.
INFY_Q4_April_22_246 | We have identified areas of investments, including doubling down our focus on digital
INFY_Q4_April_22_247 | portfolio, scaling our cloud offerings and further enhancing our capabilities in emerging
INFY_Q4_April_22_248 | technologies.
INFY_Q4_April_22_249 | We also remain committed to offer a compelling value proposition to
INFY_Q4_April_22_250 | employees through reskilling, incentivization and a holistic career growth.
INFY_Q4_April_22_251 | We plan to
INFY_Q4_April_22_252 | neutralize the impact of some of these through aggressive cost optimization and value-led
INFY_Q4_April_22_253 | pricing driven by service and brand differentiation.
INFY_Q4_April_22_254 | This, along with post-pandemic
INFY_Q4_April_22_255 | normalization of some expenses, like travel, facilities, etc, is reflected in the revised
INFY_Q4_April_22_256 | margin guidance for FY2023 of 21% to 23%.
INFY_Q4_April_22_257 | With the pandemic hopefully behind us, we hope to see many of you in person over the
INFY_Q4_April_22_258 | next few months.
INFY_Q4_April_22_259 | With that, we can open the call up for questions.
INFY_Q4_April_22_260 | Moderator
INFY_Q4_April_22_261 | Thank you very much.
INFY_Q4_April_22_262 | We will now begin the question-and-answer session.
INFY_Q4_April_22_263 | The first
INFY_Q4_April_22_264 | question is from Ankur Rudra from JP Morgan.
INFY_Q4_April_22_265 | Please go ahead.
INFY_Q4_April_22_266 | Ankur Rudra
INFY_Q4_April_22_267 | The first question is on the revenue guidance.
INFY_Q4_April_22_268 | Last year at this time Salil, the revenue
INFY_Q4_April_22_269 | guidance was a bit low at the beginning of FY2022 and at that time I would say at least the
INFY_Q4_April_22_270 | order book was a lot stronger, you had a mega deal in the order book and perhaps a
INFY_Q4_April_22_271 | stronger exit rate.
INFY_Q4_April_22_272 | So curious to know, what gives the confidence of giving a slightly higher
INFY_Q4_April_22_273 | guidance at the beginning of this year, given, may be a more volatile macro situation.
INFY_Q4_April_22_274 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q4_April_22_275 | Hi Ankur thanks for your question.
INFY_Q4_April_22_276 | What we see today is the demand environment from
INFY_Q4_April_22_277 | our client base is strong.
INFY_Q4_April_22_278 | We have for the year $9.5 bn in large deals, 40% net new, for the
INFY_Q4_April_22_279 | quarter $2.3 bn, 48% net new and a strong expansion in dimensions relating to new client
INFY_Q4_April_22_280 | work and relating to actual expansion across different strata.
INFY_Q4_April_22_281 | Given all those factors, we
INFY_Q4_April_22_282 | came to view that we could see growth in the range of 13% to 15% for this financial year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_283 | Ankur Rudra
INFY_Q4_April_22_284 | Understood this, does this bake in any kind of reversal that you alluded to from the client
INFY_Q4_April_22_285 | situation in fourth quarter?
INFY_Q4_April_22_286 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q4_April_22_287 | The client situation of the fourth quarter will reverse over some period.
INFY_Q4_April_22_288 | We have not
INFY_Q4_April_22_289 | specified that.
INFY_Q4_April_22_290 | That reversal in any case is not such that will make a huge impact in the full
INFY_Q4_April_22_291 | year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_292 | We see this coming really from the strong demand that we are seeing within the
INFY_Q4_April_22_293 | market from what we are seeing in the existing base of business that we have, the
INFY_Q4_April_22_294 | expansion within clients that we are seeing and some of the new client acquisitions that
INFY_Q4_April_22_295 | we are witnessing.
INFY_Q4_April_22_296 | So, putting all those factors we came to this view.
INFY_Q4_April_22_297 | Ankur Rudra
INFY_Q4_April_22_298 | Thank you, appreciate this.
INFY_Q4_April_22_299 | The follow up question is on margin.
INFY_Q4_April_22_300 | Maybe to start with could
INFY_Q4_April_22_301 | you elaborate the third-party cost which went up sharply this quarter and last quarter.
INFY_Q4_April_22_302 | Is
INFY_Q4_April_22_303 | this the sticky new level given the nature of deals you are signing?
INFY_Q4_April_22_304 | And as a connected
INFY_Q4_April_22_305 | question could you elaborate the cost that has been baked into to the 2023 guidance on
INFY_Q4_April_22_306 | margins including the wage inflation levels, the extent of the pace of the reversal or
INFY_Q4_April_22_307 | normalization of the cost base.
INFY_Q4_April_22_308 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_309 | I think many of the large deals which we get is through bundling our services with the
INFY_Q4_April_22_310 | software and the allied services and that gives us a multiplier effect in the client
INFY_Q4_April_22_311 | landscape.
INFY_Q4_April_22_312 | And that you have seen over the last few years, so that is one of the reason
INFY_Q4_April_22_313 | also you have seen the cost increase and has helped us in the quarter and the year going
INFY_Q4_April_22_314 | forward.
INFY_Q4_April_22_315 | On YoY perspective for FY2023 we do not call out the wage impact.
INFY_Q4_April_22_316 | As Salil said, it will be
INFY_Q4_April_22_317 | a competitive compensation hike.
INFY_Q4_April_22_318 | We will differentiate hike in talent and in some places, it
INFY_Q4_April_22_319 | will be more broad-based and of course around that we have a lot of cost optimization
INFY_Q4_April_22_320 | which we usually do.
INFY_Q4_April_22_321 | Some of them in the year past were tailwinds; for instance the onsite
INFY_Q4_April_22_322 | offshore mix.
INFY_Q4_April_22_323 | But subcon became a headwind for us last year and some of these in a way
INFY_Q4_April_22_324 | will start going the other way in the following year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_325 | Of course, the wage hikes will hit us
INFY_Q4_April_22_326 | early on the year as well in quarter one itself, so that will be initial headwind, but we have
INFY_Q4_April_22_327 | seen the overall impact of our cost optimization.
INFY_Q4_April_22_328 | On pricing, we have started discussions as Salil mentioned earlier with our clients.
INFY_Q4_April_22_329 | Of
INFY_Q4_April_22_330 | course, this is a much longer haul, it happens more on T&M, renewals etc.
INFY_Q4_April_22_331 | But for FP side
INFY_Q4_April_22_332 | of the business these are much more longer-term discussions.
INFY_Q4_April_22_333 | And these are also
INFY_Q4_April_22_334 | competitively bid but I think the discussions have started.
INFY_Q4_April_22_335 | All of our sales people are
INFY_Q4_April_22_336 | actively engaged in this and looking at the overall demand and the supply front on this and
INFY_Q4_April_22_337 | we have started making head way on this.

INFY_Q4_April_22_339 | Thank you and best of luck.

INFY_Q4_April_22_342 | Moshe Katri
INFY_Q4_April_22_343 | Thanks for taking my questions.
INFY_Q4_April_22_344 | It would be great if you can give us some more clarity and
INFY_Q4_April_22_345 | the client specific contractual position that you mentioned is getting lot of questions from
INFY_Q4_April_22_346 | the investors.
INFY_Q4_April_22_347 | How does that impact the revenue numbers for the quarter.
INFY_Q4_April_22_348 | Is there a
INFY_Q4_April_22_349 | margin impact as well?
INFY_Q4_April_22_350 | I think any clarity is going to be really helpful.
INFY_Q4_April_22_351 | And this is a followup
INFY_Q4_April_22_352 | looking at the margin guidance for FY2023, I would see you have brought down by a 100
INFY_Q4_April_22_353 | basis point.
INFY_Q4_April_22_354 | Are we assuming they picked up from the wage inflation here and then are we
INFY_Q4_April_22_355 | also assuming lower pricing power which is something that actually did help in terms of
INFY_Q4_April_22_356 | levers hardly for the past 6 to 12 months.
INFY_Q4_April_22_357 | Thanks a lot.
INFY_Q4_April_22_358 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_359 | Moshe we heard the first question on the client contractual provision.
INFY_Q4_April_22_360 | Just to clarify this the
INFY_Q4_April_22_361 | numbers are very small.
INFY_Q4_April_22_362 | These are less than a percentage, so it is not a big impact overall
INFY_Q4_April_22_363 | as people are making it out.
INFY_Q4_April_22_364 | So we just want to close that out.
INFY_Q4_April_22_365 | It is not a big impact but
INFY_Q4_April_22_366 | less than 1%.
INFY_Q4_April_22_367 | But since you are looking at revenue growth sequentially, I just wanted to
INFY_Q4_April_22_368 | call it out.
INFY_Q4_April_22_369 | ?
INFY_Q4_April_22_370 | Moshe Katri
INFY_Q4_April_22_371 | The second question is to do with your margin guidance for FY23, does this actually factor
INFY_Q4_April_22_372 | an acceleration in wage inflation in FY2023 and maybe a lower pricing power also kind of
INFY_Q4_April_22_373 | not factored into those numbers?
INFY_Q4_April_22_374 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_375 | Okay Moshe , I could make out something you said about of wage inflation as well.
INFY_Q4_April_22_376 | So
INFY_Q4_April_22_377 | yes, in Q1, we will do a compensation hike as well both offshore and onsite and like I said
INFY_Q4_April_22_378 | it will be competitive.
INFY_Q4_April_22_379 | We will benchmark this, differentiate on talent side as well.
INFY_Q4_April_22_380 | And that
INFY_Q4_April_22_381 | is something we have seen over the last year has helped us, especially towards people
INFY_Q4_April_22_382 | with the higher skills set, so that is working for us.
INFY_Q4_April_22_383 | The overall margin guidance reflects a number of events.
INFY_Q4_April_22_384 | We talked about some of the
INFY_Q4_April_22_385 | normalization of the pandemic benefits we have got on travel and facility, and some of that
INFY_Q4_April_22_386 | we are seeing is going to come back.
INFY_Q4_April_22_387 | And secondly, we are seeing some of the
INFY_Q4_April_22_388 | headwinds in terms of onsite-offshore which we think we have got a large benefit last
INFY_Q4_April_22_389 | year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_390 | So, we have to see how this opens up in the rest of the year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_391 | On the other hand, with
INFY_Q4_April_22_392 | our recruitment engine really kicking up now, we have seen subcon cost has actually
INFY_Q4_April_22_393 | plateaued during this quarter and we think for the rest of the year we should be able to pull
INFY_Q4_April_22_394 | back cost on subcon line.
INFY_Q4_April_22_395 | Automation remains very core to us – cost optimization every
INFY_Q4_April_22_396 | year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_397 | We are speaking of automating between 3000 to 4000 people and putting in BOTS
INFY_Q4_April_22_398 | and this I am talking about for the quarter, So, we have comprehensive plans and we have
INFY_Q4_April_22_399 | talked about pricing as well.
INFY_Q4_April_22_400 | 21% to 23% is a reasonable margin band we think we are
INFY_Q4_April_22_401 | comfortable to operate in for the next year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_402 | If you recall even pre pandemic in a way, we
INFY_Q4_April_22_403 | were in at 21% to 23% as we ended FY2020 which was the year before pandemic at
INFY_Q4_April_22_404 | 21.3% if I am not mistaken.
INFY_Q4_April_22_405 | So, we are at 21% to 23% and it is a comfortable range we
INFY_Q4_April_22_406 | are happy to be in.

INFY_Q4_April_22_409 | Nitin Padmanabhan
INFY_Q4_April_22_410 | Hi good evening just two questions from my side.
INFY_Q4_April_22_411 | The first one was on the guidance.
INFY_Q4_April_22_412 | So, if
INFY_Q4_April_22_413 | I understand right, typically you have a high visibility for the next two quarters and if I look
INFY_Q4_April_22_414 | at the last year net new deal wins, it is actually lower than the prior year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_415 | So I was just
INFY_Q4_April_22_416 | wondering is the mix of much smaller deals which do not reflect within the overall large
INFY_Q4_April_22_417 | deal win number that you are talking about, is that a much higher number, is that we
INFY_Q4_April_22_418 | should think about it?
INFY_Q4_April_22_419 | Second is the pipeline of larger deals that could come through that
INFY_Q4_April_22_420 | is giving the confidence or is it the smaller deals?
INFY_Q4_April_22_421 | so that was the first question.
INFY_Q4_April_22_422 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q4_April_22_423 | Thanks for the question.
INFY_Q4_April_22_424 | We are not specifying today the different types of deals within the
INFY_Q4_April_22_425 | mix.
INFY_Q4_April_22_426 | Few points to give some color on it.
INFY_Q4_April_22_427 | First the pipeline that we see today is the largest
INFY_Q4_April_22_428 | pipeline we have in terms of large deals so that gives us a good confidence.
INFY_Q4_April_22_429 | Our net new
INFY_Q4_April_22_430 | for the year is strong.
INFY_Q4_April_22_431 | We have good momentum exiting this financial year 2022, which
INFY_Q4_April_22_432 | gives us a good foundation for next year and we see continued traction within clients, as
INFY_Q4_April_22_433 | we are expanding as we are consolidating, as we are gaining market share, so that gives
INFY_Q4_April_22_434 | us added boost.
INFY_Q4_April_22_435 | Hopefully that gives you a little bit of color on that.
INFY_Q4_April_22_436 | Nitin Padmanabhan
INFY_Q4_April_22_437 | Sure.
INFY_Q4_April_22_438 | The second question was in terms of how are you seeing onsite wage inflation
INFY_Q4_April_22_439 | broadly?
INFY_Q4_April_22_440 | When you compare the prior year, do you see that at a much higher level for the
INFY_Q4_April_22_441 | industry in the US, just wanted your thoughts on that.
INFY_Q4_April_22_442 | And finally, any specifics on the
INFY_Q4_April_22_443 | financial services space which is relatively softer and for life sciences where we actually
INFY_Q4_April_22_444 | saw a sharp drop for the quarter?
INFY_Q4_April_22_445 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q4_April_22_446 | On the wage inflation, outside India is definitely higher than what we were seeing last year
INFY_Q4_April_22_447 | and that will become a part of how we factor in our overall compensation increase.
INFY_Q4_April_22_448 | Wage
INFY_Q4_April_22_449 | inflation numbers in most of the western geographies are higher today than they were 12
INFY_Q4_April_22_450 | months ago.
INFY_Q4_April_22_451 | On financial services while in the quarter we saw the QoQ was lower, the overall demand
INFY_Q4_April_22_452 | environment remains very strong for us in this segment.
INFY_Q4_April_22_453 | We see a good pipeline there.
INFY_Q4_April_22_454 | There were significant large deal wins for the year and in the quarter and we remain
INFY_Q4_April_22_455 | confident with the growth in financial services.
INFY_Q4_April_22_456 | In life sciences conversely, we had in the
INFY_Q4_April_22_457 | previous quarter several onetime large deals and that is what made the QoQ look softer.
INFY_Q4_April_22_458 | It
INFY_Q4_April_22_459 | is a smaller unit for us.
INFY_Q4_April_22_460 | So, there is much more volatility in that, but the underlying demand
INFY_Q4_April_22_461 | in life sciences looks to be in good shape.

INFY_Q4_April_22_465 | Keith Bachman
INFY_Q4_April_22_466 | I want to ask a question about what are your assumptions on attrition and utilization, how
INFY_Q4_April_22_467 | should we be thinking about those terms over FY2023 and specifically if you could
INFY_Q4_April_22_468 | correlate what is the impact in terms of your margin guidance that you provided here today
INFY_Q4_April_22_469 | of 21% to 23%?
INFY_Q4_April_22_470 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_471 | I think firstly on the utilization we are still at the higher end at 87%.
INFY_Q4_April_22_472 | We want to bring this
INFY_Q4_April_22_473 | down.
INFY_Q4_April_22_474 | Now having said that, a lot of this will happen through the influx of freshers.
INFY_Q4_April_22_475 | So it is
INFY_Q4_April_22_476 | not a dollar for a dollar in that sense.
INFY_Q4_April_22_477 | The utilization will start impacting by putting in more
INFY_Q4_April_22_478 | freshers who are at a lower cost, but will still have a margin headwind.
INFY_Q4_April_22_479 | But if you looking
INFY_Q4_April_22_480 | for a math behind it there is no straight correlation because it is not one for one in that
INFY_Q4_April_22_481 | sense.
INFY_Q4_April_22_482 | So that is first.
INFY_Q4_April_22_483 | On attrition, yes, we think that this should come down in the following year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_484 | The impact
INFY_Q4_April_22_485 | that we are seeing now – the impact of putting freshers in – not only by us, but by the
INFY_Q4_April_22_486 | entire industry because it was a rotational churn issue across the industry.
INFY_Q4_April_22_487 | As the industry
INFY_Q4_April_22_488 | puts in freshers, there is a new source of supply across the industry as well.
INFY_Q4_April_22_489 | And finally the
INFY_Q4_April_22_490 | intervention which we are doing now as well.
INFY_Q4_April_22_491 | So, that is all factored into our 21% to 23%.
INFY_Q4_April_22_492 | We are also looking at investments, like Salil said, around cloud, around digital
INFY_Q4_April_22_493 | capabilities; and therefore that is also baked into the next year’s guidance.
INFY_Q4_April_22_494 | Keith Bachman
INFY_Q4_April_22_495 | Okay just to clarify and then I will see the floor, does the attrition come down for the
INFY_Q4_April_22_496 | industry or Infosys or both.
INFY_Q4_April_22_497 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_498 | It will be both, I do not think we are in a silo on the ecosystem, we are all interconnected.
INFY_Q4_April_22_499 | My attrition is somebody else lateral and somebody else’s attrition is my lateral and
INFY_Q4_April_22_500 | therefore if the industry has to come out of this it is fundamentally through volume.
INFY_Q4_April_22_501 | Volume
INFY_Q4_April_22_502 | has to be through fresher, there is no other source of volume.
INFY_Q4_April_22_503 | Therefore, as we start
INFY_Q4_April_22_504 | pumping in more freshers send them for training put them into the bench and then get
INFY_Q4_April_22_505 | them into production.
INFY_Q4_April_22_506 | I think that cycle takes time, and you are already seeing the benefits
INFY_Q4_April_22_507 | of this – not only with us but also seeing that with the industry as well.

INFY_Q4_April_22_512 | Good evening gentlemen.
INFY_Q4_April_22_513 | Thanks for giving me the opportunity.
INFY_Q4_April_22_514 | Nilanjan as you made a
INFY_Q4_April_22_515 | comment that pre-pandemic we were at 21.3% margin and our current margin guidance
INFY_Q4_April_22_516 | band is also somewhere around that.
INFY_Q4_April_22_517 | So should we read this margin downgrade as more
INFY_Q4_April_22_518 | of a structural reset in the company’s aspirational profitability going back to pre-COVID
INFY_Q4_April_22_519 | margin levels or should we see this more of a onetime downgrade for FY2023 led by
INFY_Q4_April_22_520 | transient supply side pressures.
INFY_Q4_April_22_521 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_522 | Yes, so as you know, we only give the margin guidance for the year – 21% to 23% and
INFY_Q4_April_22_523 | FY2020 operating margin was 21.3%.
INFY_Q4_April_22_524 | We will see where we end up, but the comfortable
INFY_Q4_April_22_525 | range for FY2023 is 21% to 23% - nothing more than that.
INFY_Q4_April_22_526 | Just talking about the
INFY_Q4_April_22_527 | investments we are going to make- not only on talent.
INFY_Q4_April_22_528 | This is a robust demand
INFY_Q4_April_22_529 | environment and we do not want to lose highly skilled talents.
INFY_Q4_April_22_530 | So, we are rolling out
INFY_Q4_April_22_531 | interventions there.
INFY_Q4_April_22_532 | We are rolling out intervention on the sales side, on the marketing
INFY_Q4_April_22_533 | side, on the digital, cloud.
INFY_Q4_April_22_534 | So, we have multiple interventions and we have seen the
INFY_Q4_April_22_535 | success of that over the last 4 years and this is also in front of you.
INFY_Q4_April_22_536 | That is something
INFY_Q4_April_22_537 | which we have looked at and baked into the margin for next year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_538 | Sudheer Guntupalli
INFY_Q4_April_22_539 | Sure Sir.
INFY_Q4_April_22_540 | An extension of this question, the current exit margin rate in March 2022 and
INFY_Q4_April_22_541 | margin downgrade for FY2023 it gives a bit of a deja vu feeling of the exit margin and
INFY_Q4_April_22_542 | guidance situation exactly 3 years ago in March 2019.
INFY_Q4_April_22_543 | In fact, we were not staring at so
INFY_Q4_April_22_544 | many margin headwinds like we are now barring a bit of an elevated attrition at that time.
INFY_Q4_April_22_545 | So my question is, is it fair to assume that for the next four quarters margin trajectory will
INFY_Q4_April_22_546 | trace somewhat of a similar path like getting FY2020 where the current delta in growth will
INFY_Q4_April_22_547 | likely take care of the delta in margin headwinds or do you see any major divergences in
INFY_Q4_April_22_548 | terms of how the pattern will play out over the next four quarters.
INFY_Q4_April_22_549 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_550 | So, yes like I said on the margin side we know there is going to be a Q1 impact.
INFY_Q4_April_22_551 | We know
INFY_Q4_April_22_552 | there are more longer-term cost optimizations we can resort to.
INFY_Q4_April_22_553 | So, I think it will be
INFY_Q4_April_22_554 | multiple impact of all this.
INFY_Q4_April_22_555 | And of course, growth will always help.
INFY_Q4_April_22_556 | And you've seen that the
INFY_Q4_April_22_557 | impact of growth on our operating leverage also has helped in the past.
INFY_Q4_April_22_558 | So, it's a
INFY_Q4_April_22_559 | combination of all this.

INFY_Q4_April_22_562 | Divya Nagarajan
INFY_Q4_April_22_563 | Thanks for taking my question and congrats on what has been a great year overall.
INFY_Q4_April_22_564 | Looking forward I think this question has been attempted in different ways by some of the
INFY_Q4_April_22_565 | earlier questions that came through, but if you were to kind of think about your guidance
INFY_Q4_April_22_566 | on revenue for the full year and think about what are the puts and takes in terms of any
INFY_Q4_April_22_567 | delta that you might see on demand, how comfortable do you feel that you have a
INFY_Q4_April_22_568 | cushion?
INFY_Q4_April_22_569 | If I also look at your past track record, you have taken up guidance pretty much
INFY_Q4_April_22_570 | every year consistently multiple times during the year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_571 | Is there enough buffer on both
INFY_Q4_April_22_572 | sides of the equation is my first question.
INFY_Q4_April_22_573 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q4_April_22_574 | The way we looked at our growth guidance, we really try to take a look at where is the
INFY_Q4_April_22_575 | demand today, what we have done with large deals, what we are seeing across many of
INFY_Q4_April_22_576 | our accounts.
INFY_Q4_April_22_577 | For example, if you see some of the statistics that we share, number of
INFY_Q4_April_22_578 | accounts over $100 mn or $50 mn- they have seen big movements over the last 12, 24,
INFY_Q4_April_22_579 | 36 months.
INFY_Q4_April_22_580 | So we have some view of how that will move in the coming year and then how
INFY_Q4_April_22_581 | we are working on new account acquisitions and focus on that.
INFY_Q4_April_22_582 | Those are the things we
INFY_Q4_April_22_583 | built in, to build the guidance and that is the approach we take every year and in April as
INFY_Q4_April_22_584 | we look ahead and then as the year moves, as we get other information we try to then see
INFY_Q4_April_22_585 | how best to communicate what we are seeing in the demand environment.
INFY_Q4_April_22_586 | It’s the same
INFY_Q4_April_22_587 | approach that we will follow.
INFY_Q4_April_22_588 | So, it is difficult for example to say what does it mean there is
INFY_Q4_April_22_589 | a cushion and not cushion because at this stage what we see is what we are sharing
INFY_Q4_April_22_590 | which is 13% to 15% on the growth and in every quarter with the broad-based connection
INFY_Q4_April_22_591 | we have with clients and interactions across the industry we will continue to share what we
INFY_Q4_April_22_592 | see with respect to the demand environment.
INFY_Q4_April_22_593 | Divya Nagarajan
INFY_Q4_April_22_594 | Got it and on the margin side I think you have spoken repeatedly about investments and
INFY_Q4_April_22_595 | the investments for future growth.
INFY_Q4_April_22_596 | If you were to split your margin you have taken your
INFY_Q4_April_22_597 | guide down roughly by a percent, could you split it into what could be the contribution of
INFY_Q4_April_22_598 | the investments and what is really the contribution of all the other metrics that you have
INFY_Q4_April_22_599 | talked about that are likely to reverse.
INFY_Q4_April_22_600 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_601 | Yes, so like I said, every year we have headwinds on compensation, that is the biggest
INFY_Q4_April_22_602 | one.
INFY_Q4_April_22_603 | We have headwinds this year coming on the travel and the facility side as things
INFY_Q4_April_22_604 | open up.
INFY_Q4_April_22_605 | And then we have the cost optimization program which has been running quite
INFY_Q4_April_22_606 | well across all these years – automation, onsite-offshore, subcon – again which is also
INFY_Q4_April_22_607 | high, and then the investments which we are going to make.
INFY_Q4_April_22_608 | We will start the investments
INFY_Q4_April_22_609 | during the year and this will be on sales side, cloud capabilities, people incentives on
INFY_Q4_April_22_610 | higher skill sets.
INFY_Q4_April_22_611 | So, it is a combination of all this.
INFY_Q4_April_22_612 | We are not really calling out the
INFY_Q4_April_22_613 | separate impact and all of that has been considered into the margin structure.
INFY_Q4_April_22_614 | Divya Nagarajan
INFY_Q4_April_22_615 | Got it.
INFY_Q4_April_22_616 | My last question if I may.
INFY_Q4_April_22_617 | So should I assume that your increased visa cost that you
INFY_Q4_April_22_618 | have had, you have almost had like 1% impact in the quarter, the higher visa application is
INFY_Q4_April_22_619 | to kind of offset some of the subcontracting pressures that you have had now with travel
INFY_Q4_April_22_620 | opening up in the western market.
INFY_Q4_April_22_621 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_622 | Yes so as I mentioned, the impact in the margin walk was a combination of visa, third-
INFY_Q4_April_22_623 | party cost and another one off which we enjoyed in quarter three, that was altogether 1%
INFY_Q4_April_22_624 | in margin walk which I took you through.
INFY_Q4_April_22_625 | Divya Nagarajan
INFY_Q4_April_22_626 | Got it thanks I will come for follow up if there is any time and wish you all the best for the
INFY_Q4_April_22_627 | year.

INFY_Q4_April_22_631 | Hi!
INFY_Q4_April_22_632 | Thanks for the opportunity.
INFY_Q4_April_22_633 | The question again is on margins and the investment that
INFY_Q4_April_22_634 | you spoke of.
INFY_Q4_April_22_635 | I was just wondering are these similar to the investment that you had done
INFY_Q4_April_22_636 | in 2018-2019, so more of one time kind of an investment or these are more regular
INFY_Q4_April_22_637 | investments that anyway you would keep doing in the business.
INFY_Q4_April_22_638 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q4_April_22_639 | I think the way we are looking at it is, we put in place that strategy a few years ago.
INFY_Q4_April_22_640 | We
INFY_Q4_April_22_641 | built out deep capability across multiple areas – that was what we did in the first sort of 6
INFY_Q4_April_22_642 | months, a year or so.
INFY_Q4_April_22_643 | We are now seeing over the last 4 years a good impact of that
INFY_Q4_April_22_644 | approach.
INFY_Q4_April_22_645 | We see a tremendous demand environment which we see across cloud, areas
INFY_Q4_April_22_646 | of digital, automation, and some of the new digital tech companies.
INFY_Q4_April_22_647 | We want to take that
INFY_Q4_April_22_648 | and build the capability deeper in those areas.
INFY_Q4_April_22_649 | We consider that now one time approach in
INFY_Q4_April_22_650 | the next few quarters to get it mobilized.
INFY_Q4_April_22_651 | It is not something which is going to be a
INFY_Q4_April_22_652 | continuous new activity for us and then we want to again like we did last time a shift into
INFY_Q4_April_22_653 | building capability from the operating business itself.
INFY_Q4_April_22_654 | But since we see an inflection point
INFY_Q4_April_22_655 | in what we see as the opportunity set, we want to make sure we take advantage of that,
INFY_Q4_April_22_656 | keep our leading position with market share growth that we have had over the past 3-4
INFY_Q4_April_22_657 | years and try to build on that for the coming 3 to 5 years.
INFY_Q4_April_22_658 | Pankaj Kapoor
INFY_Q4_April_22_659 | Understand that, and the other question also was on your guidance on the revenue side.
INFY_Q4_April_22_660 | What kind of a outlook you are building in on the macro concerns around what is
INFY_Q4_April_22_661 | happening in the Eastern Europe or even the larger macro worries around the inflation in
INFY_Q4_April_22_662 | your end markets.
INFY_Q4_April_22_663 | Are you taking any impact of that, maybe in the second half of the year,
INFY_Q4_April_22_664 | or the guidance is more on an ‘as is’ basis and in case if there is any incremental
INFY_Q4_April_22_665 | deterioration in the macros that would be probably incremental to whatever the guidance
INFY_Q4_April_22_666 | that we have given.
INFY_Q4_April_22_667 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q4_April_22_668 | Today what we see is the point that you mentioned are in the macro environment, but as
INFY_Q4_April_22_669 | we look at our demand environment we do not see any impact to it.
INFY_Q4_April_22_670 | And we do not have a
INFY_Q4_April_22_671 | clear view of how to make an estimate for Q3, Q4 at what level and so on.
INFY_Q4_April_22_672 | Based on that
INFY_Q4_April_22_673 | we have built the guidance today and we will evolve it as we go through.
INFY_Q4_April_22_674 | We feel
INFY_Q4_April_22_675 | comfortable given what we are seeing in the environment that this is the sort of growth
INFY_Q4_April_22_676 | that we will see in the range of 13% to 15%.
INFY_Q4_April_22_677 | We do not see really an impact of those
INFY_Q4_April_22_678 | factors in the demand environment today.
INFY_Q4_April_22_679 | Moderator
INFY_Q4_April_22_680 | go ahead.
INFY_Q4_April_22_681 | Vibhor Singhal
INFY_Q4_April_22_682 | Salil couple of questions again on the European part.
INFY_Q4_April_22_683 | My first question is that as you have
INFY_Q4_April_22_684 | already mentioned that our exposure to Russia and the other geographies as of now is
INFY_Q4_April_22_685 | limited, just wanted to basically understand, as we work for a lot of multinational clients
INFY_Q4_April_22_686 | who have operations across countries and in parts of Russia and Europe as well.
INFY_Q4_April_22_687 | So, what
INFY_Q4_April_22_688 | are the conversations with those clients like.
INFY_Q4_April_22_689 | Is there a possibility of them maybe curtailing
INFY_Q4_April_22_690 | down this to some extent or is there some negativity in the conversation that is creeping
INFY_Q4_April_22_691 | in.
INFY_Q4_April_22_692 | Second, a more longer-term question on the same geography is that, over the last 2 to 3
INFY_Q4_April_22_693 | years, in fact more than that last 4-5 years we have seen eastern Europe evolve as a
INFY_Q4_April_22_694 | destination for hiring for a lot of companies maybe in data analytics and many other
INFY_Q4_April_22_695 | domains.
INFY_Q4_April_22_696 | Do you believe that the current war situation has pushed that back by maybe a
INFY_Q4_April_22_697 | few quarters or years or do you think it is a temporary situation and once it resolves, the
INFY_Q4_April_22_698 | earlier attractiveness of eastern Europe vis-à-vis hiring for the specific domains will still
INFY_Q4_April_22_699 | come back as it was before?
INFY_Q4_April_22_700 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q4_April_22_701 | So, I have understood first was is the situation in Ukraine impacting any demand in
INFY_Q4_April_22_702 | European clients if that is the question - currently our conversations and discussions with
INFY_Q4_April_22_703 | clients in Europe do not see any impact on the demand environment for us because of this
INFY_Q4_April_22_704 | situation.
INFY_Q4_April_22_705 | Of course as we go through the next few quarters and so on we will see how it
INFY_Q4_April_22_706 | plays out depending on the duration and so on.
INFY_Q4_April_22_707 | On the second one, the recruitment situation, we have centers for example in countries in
INFY_Q4_April_22_708 | Eastern Europe and we see that growing quite well for us.
INFY_Q4_April_22_709 | Today we have no center in
INFY_Q4_April_22_710 | Ukraine but the other areas we have been expanding in and that has developed quite well.
INFY_Q4_April_22_711 | We do not see an impact today – there might obviously be impact with centers in Ukraine.
INFY_Q4_April_22_712 | So our centers which are in other geographies in Eastern Europe, we are seeing good
INFY_Q4_April_22_713 | growth in those centers.
INFY_Q4_April_22_714 | Vibhor Singhal
INFY_Q4_April_22_715 | So if I were to specifically ask something like Hungary, Poland, Austria they would
INFY_Q4_April_22_716 | continue to remain attractive destinations for us to hire and do businesses there.
INFY_Q4_April_22_717 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q4_April_22_718 | Poland and Romania are the locations where we have centers and we are actively
INFY_Q4_April_22_719 | recruiting and scaling up in those locations.
INFY_Q4_April_22_720 | Vibhor Singhal
INFY_Q4_April_22_721 | Got it, thanks for taking my questions and wish you all the best.

INFY_Q4_April_22_723 | ahead.
INFY_Q4_April_22_724 | Ravi Menon
INFY_Q4_April_22_725 | Thank you for the opportunity.
INFY_Q4_April_22_726 | Just want to clarify on this pass through cost, should we not
INFY_Q4_April_22_727 | think of this as like a margin tailwind whenever this pass through cost reduces because I
INFY_Q4_April_22_728 | assume that your customers have the option let us say if it is the ServiceNow software,
INFY_Q4_April_22_729 | they can procure it themselves.
INFY_Q4_April_22_730 | So, I would assume that these are done at zero markup
INFY_Q4_April_22_731 | would that be correct?
INFY_Q4_April_22_732 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_733 | Yes, these are long-term contracts and I think the value proposition which we have is how
INFY_Q4_April_22_734 | we bundle services with these software.
INFY_Q4_April_22_735 | So, it is just not a one-off sale.
INFY_Q4_April_22_736 | I think that the
INFY_Q4_April_22_737 | proposition with us, is that we can integrate this into the cloud into the vertical stacks etc.
INFY_Q4_April_22_738 | and bundle that with the services which we have.
INFY_Q4_April_22_739 | So that is the way we look at it.
INFY_Q4_April_22_740 | Ravi Menon
INFY_Q4_April_22_741 | But my question was what should we assume as a margin for this, should we assume that
INFY_Q4_April_22_742 | this is a margin tailwind, should we think of this and adjust for the margins accordingly.
INFY_Q4_April_22_743 | I
INFY_Q4_April_22_744 | assume that this is a zero margin because the client can actually procure that and just ask
INFY_Q4_April_22_745 | you to implement it.
INFY_Q4_April_22_746 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_747 | But as you see the overall market for software as a service is growing dramatically and
INFY_Q4_April_22_748 | that is something where we can come in and add this value.
INFY_Q4_April_22_749 | So, it is just not one client
INFY_Q4_April_22_750 | with one software there are multiple clients, there are horizontal softwares, various kinds
INFY_Q4_April_22_751 | as well.
INFY_Q4_April_22_752 | So, I think this is a proposition which we have which is quite unique for us so you
INFY_Q4_April_22_753 | just cannot see it as a one-off intervention with one client.
INFY_Q4_April_22_754 | Ravi Menon
INFY_Q4_April_22_755 | So are you saying these are software that you own, this is your intellectual property, I
INFY_Q4_April_22_756 | thought these are third party items bought for service delivery.
INFY_Q4_April_22_757 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_758 | Yes like I said these are software which are of course owned by the SaaS vendors but the
INFY_Q4_April_22_759 | bundling of services which we do with it, that is the value proposition we give to our client.
INFY_Q4_April_22_760 | Ravi Menon
INFY_Q4_April_22_761 | Second question is, if you look at the incremental revenue this quarter we added about
INFY_Q4_April_22_762 | $30 mn, last quarter we added north of $50 mn, if I remember correctly and this quarter
INFY_Q4_April_22_763 | the increase in pass through cost is $40 mn.
INFY_Q4_April_22_764 | So, if I just for that, your services revenue
INFY_Q4_April_22_765 | has dropped in a surprisingly strong demand environment.
INFY_Q4_April_22_766 | So how should we think about
INFY_Q4_April_22_767 | it?
INFY_Q4_April_22_768 | I mean is it that certain projects have come to an end and this is across the board, I
INFY_Q4_April_22_769 | mean we have seen decline in Life sciences both in North America and Europe.
INFY_Q4_April_22_770 | But it is
INFY_Q4_April_22_771 | not that this one vertical that dragged you down or a particular client, it seems to be the
INFY_Q4_April_22_772 | incremental revenue is soft across the board so how should we think about that.
INFY_Q4_April_22_773 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_774 | Yes so firstly, volume growth sequentially has been very strong first point.
INFY_Q4_April_22_775 | Second point if
INFY_Q4_April_22_776 | you see our YoY, it is 20.6% versus 19.7% for the year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_777 | Our number for exit rate is higher
INFY_Q4_April_22_778 | than the average for the year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_779 | Number two our volumes growth sequentially is higher, we
INFY_Q4_April_22_780 | have added 22,000 people this quarter and I am assuming many of these are being hired
INFY_Q4_April_22_781 | to look for future demand and get them into production so that is the third signal we have
INFY_Q4_April_22_782 | got.
INFY_Q4_April_22_783 | Fourth if you see from a revenue perspective versus the volume increase we have
INFY_Q4_April_22_784 | seen.
INFY_Q4_April_22_785 | We have talked about the seasonality of quarter four, and if you look back over the
INFY_Q4_April_22_786 | last 5-6 years we have always had a seasonality of revenue versus volume in quarter four
INFY_Q4_April_22_787 | because of the working day impact.
INFY_Q4_April_22_788 | We have seen some COVID leave in the initial part of
INFY_Q4_April_22_789 | January impacting us.
INFY_Q4_April_22_790 | We had this one off we have just talked about the commercial
INFY_Q4_April_22_791 | contract for one client and of course there are some other puts and takes.
INFY_Q4_April_22_792 | So I do not
INFY_Q4_April_22_793 | think you can just see quarter four in isolation.
INFY_Q4_April_22_794 | We would not have given a guidance of
INFY_Q4_April_22_795 | 13% to 15% - this is probably the highest guidance we have given at the start of the year
INFY_Q4_April_22_796 | in the last 10 years at least.
INFY_Q4_April_22_797 | So I think all the demand indicators and landmarks are
INFY_Q4_April_22_798 | looking very good.
INFY_Q4_April_22_799 | Ravi Menon
INFY_Q4_April_22_800 | One last question on the utilization.
INFY_Q4_April_22_801 | You are talking about cooling it down a little.
INFY_Q4_April_22_802 | What
INFY_Q4_April_22_803 | would be a good range that we should think about, would it come down to about 85% or
INFY_Q4_April_22_804 | so, would that be sufficient or should we think even lower.
INFY_Q4_April_22_805 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_806 | Yes, so 85% is the number – it may go up or down in the quarter but that would be
INFY_Q4_April_22_807 | somewhere where we would be – more or less in the comfort range as well.
INFY_Q4_April_22_808 | Moderator
INFY_Q4_April_22_809 | Please go ahead.
INFY_Q4_April_22_810 | Jamie Friedman
INFY_Q4_April_22_811 | Nilanjan, I believe that you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you are anticipating
INFY_Q4_April_22_812 | that the subcontractor costs are plateauing.
INFY_Q4_April_22_813 | I was just wondering why you are concluding
INFY_Q4_April_22_814 | that, is that Visa related or is there something else we should be aware of.
INFY_Q4_April_22_815 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_816 | So, our subcon costs are pretty much plateaued at around 11.1% in this quarter as a
INFY_Q4_April_22_817 | percentage of revenue, but from an exit headcount perspective it has actually come down.
INFY_Q4_April_22_818 | And the reason for this whole ramp up of this subcons is our recruitment engine was a bit
INFY_Q4_April_22_819 | behind.
INFY_Q4_April_22_820 | We were hiring 11,000, 12,000 people each quarter and the balance demand was
INFY_Q4_April_22_821 | being fulfilled by subcons.
INFY_Q4_April_22_822 | With us now getting into this mode of hiring freshers, we hired
INFY_Q4_April_22_823 | 22,000 people this quarter which is close to about 7% of the exit headcount.
INFY_Q4_April_22_824 | And as we
INFY_Q4_April_22_825 | look ahead we will continue to push on the pedal in terms of recruitment and replace many
INFY_Q4_April_22_826 | of the subcons either through a replacement system or what we call a program of ‘subcon
INFY_Q4_April_22_827 | to hires’ in which we offer them a full time employment within the company.
INFY_Q4_April_22_828 | So, we have
INFY_Q4_April_22_829 | been doing that.
INFY_Q4_April_22_830 | We have been at the lowest of the industry in 2019-2020 in terms of
INFY_Q4_April_22_831 | subcon.
INFY_Q4_April_22_832 | So, we know where we have to get at.
INFY_Q4_April_22_833 | It may take us some time, a few quarters,
INFY_Q4_April_22_834 | but we know that's the margin lever we can press on.
INFY_Q4_April_22_835 | Jamie Friedman
INFY_Q4_April_22_836 | Thank you and then I believe Nilanjan you also had quantified the client contract provision,
INFY_Q4_April_22_837 | could you repeat the percentage impact if you stated it.
INFY_Q4_April_22_838 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_839 | So it is less than a percentage and we think over a period of time this should come back.
INFY_Q4_April_22_840 | Jamie Friedman
INFY_Q4_April_22_841 | Got it, thank you I will get back in the queue.

INFY_Q4_April_22_843 | go ahead.
INFY_Q4_April_22_844 | Kumar Rakesh
INFY_Q4_April_22_845 | Good evening, thank you for taking my question.
INFY_Q4_April_22_846 | My first question was more around the
INFY_Q4_April_22_847 | margin and the guidance which we have reduced a bit.
INFY_Q4_April_22_848 | So is this a reflection of some of
INFY_Q4_April_22_849 | the transient impacts which we are seeing especially about some of the things which you
INFY_Q4_April_22_850 | talked about supply side constraint and the investment which we are making or is there a
INFY_Q4_April_22_851 | structural change in some of the cost structure of the deals which we are making.
INFY_Q4_April_22_852 | So, as
INFY_Q4_April_22_853 | we have strong growth in some of the additional cost which comes along with that through
INFY_Q4_April_22_854 | third party and other things are essentially pushing our margin down?
INFY_Q4_April_22_855 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_856 | No, so the last part is I think quite clear, if you have seen actually our large deal strategy
INFY_Q4_April_22_857 | which we announced in the beginning of FY2019, we were then doing about $3 bn large
INFY_Q4_April_22_858 | deal.
INFY_Q4_April_22_859 | So we went from $3 bn to $6 bn to $9 bn to $14 bn, so while large deals actually
INFY_Q4_April_22_860 | went up even our margins went up.
INFY_Q4_April_22_861 | So some of that impact which people fear, when we
INFY_Q4_April_22_862 | go into large deals in the initial part of the cycle, of course headwinds are there because
INFY_Q4_April_22_863 | clients want cost savings upfront.
INFY_Q4_April_22_864 | But we are clear about the deal tenure and how do we
INFY_Q4_April_22_865 | price the deal so that over a period of time we are able to take out costs from our various
INFY_Q4_April_22_866 | levers which we have and come closer to the portfolio margin.
INFY_Q4_April_22_867 | So that is something we
INFY_Q4_April_22_868 | have been doing for the last 3, 4, 5 years, 10 years in this industry.
INFY_Q4_April_22_869 | I think the impact we
INFY_Q4_April_22_870 | are talking about is much more about the investments we want to make around what we
INFY_Q4_April_22_871 | have seen in the past, the success of what we have done, and we think with this robust
INFY_Q4_April_22_872 | demand environment these are new capabilities we should invest in as we progress.
INFY_Q4_April_22_873 | And
INFY_Q4_April_22_874 | the usual headwinds which we talked about, the bigger differentiation is the pandemic cost
INFY_Q4_April_22_875 | normalizing and I think you all have the numbers in terms of travel, utilization, onsite-
INFY_Q4_April_22_876 | offshore, subcon.
INFY_Q4_April_22_877 | So, some of those you can start triangulating what is going to come
INFY_Q4_April_22_878 | back on return to normal.
INFY_Q4_April_22_879 | Kumar Rakesh
INFY_Q4_April_22_880 | Got it thanks for that.
INFY_Q4_April_22_881 | Our large deal wins which we report have been steady between $2,
INFY_Q4_April_22_882 | $2.5 bn for the last few quarters.
INFY_Q4_April_22_883 | To understand a lot of the deal activity is also happening
INFY_Q4_April_22_884 | in the smaller size which is not getting reflected here.
INFY_Q4_April_22_885 | So would you give sense on the
INFY_Q4_April_22_886 | overall deal size how that being trending or would you consider sharing that data on an
INFY_Q4_April_22_887 | ongoing basis?
INFY_Q4_April_22_888 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q4_April_22_889 | I think at this stage we are not sharing that data outside.
INFY_Q4_April_22_890 | Our focus was to share some of
INFY_Q4_April_22_891 | the areas which we had made sort of a change a few years ago for example the digital
INFY_Q4_April_22_892 | revenue percentage and the large deal value.
INFY_Q4_April_22_893 | What you mentioned of course is accurate,
INFY_Q4_April_22_894 | we have tremendous activity across all these sizes, we have a very robust overall pipeline
INFY_Q4_April_22_895 | and also a very robust conversion with net new which also feeds a little bit into the earlier
INFY_Q4_April_22_896 | discussion on our revenue growth guidance.
INFY_Q4_April_22_897 | Kumar Rakesh
INFY_Q4_April_22_898 | Great one final thing, I think I heard that you talk about 85,000 fresher hiring which we
INFY_Q4_April_22_899 | have done this fiscal year any target which we have set for next fiscal year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_900 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q4_April_22_901 | For next year's campus recruiting we have not communicated that beyond saying that we
INFY_Q4_April_22_902 | will do more than 50,000 campus recruits for next year.
INFY_Q4_April_22_903 | As we go through the year we will
INFY_Q4_April_22_904 | communicate more on that but today we see an active campus recruitment program.
INFY_Q4_April_22_905 | Kumar Rakesh
INFY_Q4_April_22_906 | Got it, thanks for that, I will fall back in the queue.

INFY_Q4_April_22_908 | Please go ahead.
INFY_Q4_April_22_909 | Sandeep Shah
INFY_Q4_April_22_910 | Thanks for the opportunity.
INFY_Q4_April_22_911 | Most of the questions are answered.
INFY_Q4_April_22_912 | Just wanted to
INFY_Q4_April_22_913 | understand the gap between the utilization including trainee and excluding trainees is as
INFY_Q4_April_22_914 | big as 700 basis points and we are adding freshers for last so many quarters and with that
INFY_Q4_April_22_915 | you are also expecting subcontracting cost savings, is it fair to say second half of FY2023
INFY_Q4_April_22_916 | margin may have more upward bias?
INFY_Q4_April_22_917 | Pricing, with a lag may also be a tailwind versus first
INFY_Q4_April_22_918 | half?
INFY_Q4_April_22_919 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_920 | Yes, these trainees have to go through the whole Mysore stint, then they go to the bench,
INFY_Q4_April_22_921 | they get reskilled on specialty skills, and then we lead them into production.
INFY_Q4_April_22_922 | So it takes
INFY_Q4_April_22_923 | some time as well and which is why utilization excluding trainees and including trainees
INFY_Q4_April_22_924 | you see the gap.
INFY_Q4_April_22_925 | We have an increase in the overall trainee count as well between
INFY_Q4_April_22_926 | quarter-to-quarter who have not been deployed in projects.
INFY_Q4_April_22_927 | But from a margin perspective
INFY_Q4_April_22_928 | I am not sure this is a big part of the headwind of H1vs.
INFY_Q4_April_22_929 | H2.
INFY_Q4_April_22_930 | I think the H1 impact because
INFY_Q4_April_22_931 | of the comp increase is upfront one which happens every year and you can go back 2
INFY_Q4_April_22_932 | years and see that as well, but overall for the year at 21% to 23% we are quite
INFY_Q4_April_22_933 | comfortable.
INFY_Q4_April_22_934 | Sandeep Shah
INFY_Q4_April_22_935 | And just a clarification Nilanjan, just further to what Ravi has asked.
INFY_Q4_April_22_936 | So, even if you look at
INFY_Q4_April_22_937 | the revenue growth excluding third party has marginal decline but at the same time you
INFY_Q4_April_22_938 | are also saying the volumes have gone up, so is it the offshore effort in this quarter has
INFY_Q4_April_22_939 | not actually gone down so why is the volume growth not getting reflected in the revenue
INFY_Q4_April_22_940 | growth ex pass through as a whole.
INFY_Q4_April_22_941 | So is it the realization in this quarter slightly lower?
INFY_Q4_April_22_942 | Nilanjan Roy
INFY_Q4_April_22_943 | No, we have some routine puts and takes, one is always if you go back you will always
INFY_Q4_April_22_944 | see the seasonality due to working days.
INFY_Q4_April_22_945 | The second one is the COVID impact in the
INFY_Q4_April_22_946 | initial part of the year; and the third one is the one contractual provision which we made
INFY_Q4_April_22_947 | for a client.
INFY_Q4_April_22_948 | So I think these are the areas due to which you are not seeing that volume
INFY_Q4_April_22_949 | benefits flowing into revenue.
INFY_Q4_April_22_950 | Like Salil also said, we have seen strong sequential
INFY_Q4_April_22_951 | quarterly volumes.
INFY_Q4_April_22_952 | Moderator
INFY_Q4_April_22_953 | Thank you.
INFY_Q4_April_22_954 | Ladies and gentlemen that was the last question for today.
INFY_Q4_April_22_955 | I now hand the
INFY_Q4_April_22_956 | conference over to the management for closing comments.
INFY_Q4_April_22_957 | Salil Parekh
INFY_Q4_April_22_958 | discussed and mentioned.
INFY_Q4_April_22_959 | First FY2022 was an extremely strong year for us – close to
INFY_Q4_April_22_960 | 20% growth, 23% margin.
INFY_Q4_April_22_961 | We are clearly taking market share and really connecting very
INFY_Q4_April_22_962 | strongly with our clients for all the digital and cloud work.
INFY_Q4_April_22_963 | As we go ahead we want to focus on the ever expanding opportunity set in cloud, digital,
INFY_Q4_April_22_964 | data, analytics, automation, and in doing that we want to make sure that we remain a
INFY_Q4_April_22_965 | leader in the pack and continue the market share taking that we have been doing.
INFY_Q4_April_22_966 | We also
INFY_Q4_April_22_967 | want to focus on our employees with increased engagement and increased methods of
INFY_Q4_April_22_968 | working with their compensation increases and career progressions.
INFY_Q4_April_22_969 | Putting all of that
INFY_Q4_April_22_970 | together we come to a growth guidance of 13% to 15% for this financial year 2023 and a
INFY_Q4_April_22_971 | margin guidance of 21% to 23%.
INFY_Q4_April_22_972 | We have a strong outlook and we look forward to
INFY_Q4_April_22_973 | working with our clients and employees for this outlook to be delivered in financial year
INFY_Q4_April_22_974 | 2023.
INFY_Q4_April_22_975 | one-on-ones in the quarter.
INFY_Q4_April_22_976 | Take care.
